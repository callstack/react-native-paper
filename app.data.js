If you have a vanilla React Native project, it's a good idea to add it in the component which is passed to `AppRegistry.registerComponent`. This will usually be in the `index.js` file. If you have a CRNA or Expo project, you can do this inside the exported component in the `App.js` file.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';\nimport { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('main', () => Main);\n```\n\nThe `PaperProvider` component provides the theme to all the components in the framework. It also acts as a portal to components which need to be rendered at the top level.\n\nIf you have another provider (such as `Redux`), wrap it outside `PaperProvider` so that the context is available to components rendered inside a `Modal` from the library:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport { Provider as StoreProvider } from 'redux';\nimport App from './src/App';\nimport store from './store';\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <StoreProvider store={store}>\n      <PaperProvider>\n        <App />\n      </PaperProvider>\n    </StoreProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can provide a custom theme to customize the colors, fonts etc. with the `Provider` component. Check the [default theme](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/master/src/styles/DefaultTheme.js) to see what customization options are supported.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { DefaultTheme, Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nconst theme = {\n  ...DefaultTheme,\n  colors: {\n    ...DefaultTheme.colors,\n    primary: 'tomato',\n    accent: 'yellow',\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider theme={theme}>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n","type":"markdown"},{"title":"Theming","path":"theming","data":"\n## Applying a theme to the whole app\n\nTo support custom themes, paper exports a `Provider` component. You need to wrap your root component with the provider to be able to support themes.\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIf no prop is specified, this will apply the [default theme](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/master/src/styles/DefaultTheme.js) to the components. You can also provide a `theme` prop with a theme object with same properties as the default theme:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { DefaultTheme, Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nconst theme = {\n  ...DefaultTheme,\n  roundness: 2,\n  colors: {\n    ...DefaultTheme.colors,\n    primary: '#3498db',\n    accent: '#f1c40f',\n  }\n};\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider theme={theme}>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nYou can change the theme prop dynamically and all the components will automatically update to reflect the new theme.\n\nA theme usually contains the following properties:\n\n- `dark` (`boolean`): whether this is a dark theme or light theme.\n- `roundness` (`number`): roundness of common elements, such as buttons.\n- `colors` (`object`): various colors used throught different elements.\n  - `primary` - primary color for your app, usually your brand color.\n  - `accent` - secondary color for your app which complements the primary color.\n  - `background` - background color for pages, such as lists.\n  - `paper` - background color for elements containing content, such as cards.\n  - `text` - text color for content.\n  - `disabled` - color for disabled elements.\n  - `placeholder` - color for placeholder text, such as input placeholder.\n- `fonts` (`object`): various fonts used throught different elements.\n  - `regular`\n  - `medium`\n  - `light`\n  - `thin`\n\nWhen creating a custom theme, you will need to provide all of these properties.\n\n## Applying a theme to a paper component\n\nIf you want to change the theme for a certain component from the library, you can directly pass the `theme` prop to the component. The theme passed as the prop is merged with the theme from the `Provider`.\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Button } from 'react-native-paper';\n\nexport default function ButtonExample() {\n  return (\n    <Button raised theme={{ roundness: 3 }}>\n      Press me\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Using the theme in your own components\n\nTo access the theme in your own components, you can use the `withTheme` HOC exported from the library. If you wrap your component with the HOC, you'll receive the theme as a prop.\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { withTheme } from 'react-native-paper';\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  const { colors } = props.theme;\n  return <Text style={{ color: colors.primary }}>Yo!</Text>;\n}\n\nexport default withTheme(MyComponent);\n```\n\nComponents wrapped with `withTheme` support the theme from the `Provider` as well as from the `theme` prop.\n\n## Gotchas\n\nThe `Provider` exposes the theme to the components via [React's context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), which means that the component must be in the same tree as the `Provider`. Some React Native components will render a different tree such as a `Modal`, in which case the components inside the `Modal` won't be able to access the theme. The work around is to get the theme using the `withTheme` HOC and pass it down to the components as props, or expose it again with the exported `ThemeProvider` component.\n\nThe `Modal` component from the library already handles this edge case, so you won't need to do anything.\n","type":"markdown"},{"title":"Icons","path":"icons","data":"\n## Configuring icons\n\nMany of the components require the [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) library to render correctly. If you're using CRNA or Expo, you don't need to do anything extra, but if it's vanilla React Native project, you need link the library as described in the getting started guide.\n\n## Using the `icon` prop\n\nMany components such as `Button` accept an `icon` prop which is used to display an icon. The `icon` prop supports the following type of values:\n\n### 1. An icon name\n\nYou can pass the name of an icon from [`MaterialIcon`](https://material.io/icons/). This will use the [`react-native-vector-icons`](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) library to display the icon.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n<Button icon=\"add-a-photo\">\n  Press me\n</Button>\n```\n\n### 2. An image source\n\nYou can pass an image source, such as an object of shape `{ uri: 'https://path.to' }` or a local image: `require('../path/to/image.png')` to use as an icon. The image might be rendered with a different color than the one provided depending on the component. If don't want this behavior, see the next example to pass an `Image` element.\n\nRemote image:\n\n```js\n<Button icon={{ uri: 'https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/17571969?v=3&s=400' }}>\n  Press me\n</Button>\n```\n\nLocal image:\n\n```js\n<Button icon={require('../assets/chameleon.jpg')}>\n  Press me\n</Button>\n```\n\n### 3. A React element\n\nYou can pass any react element to be used an icon. The element is used as is without any modification. However, it might get clipped if the provided element's size are bigger than what the component renders. It's upto you to make sure that the size of the element is correct.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n<Button\n  icon={\n    <Image\n     source={require('../assets/chameleon.jpg')}\n     style={{ width: 16, height: 16, borderRadius: 10 }}\n    />\n  }\n>\n  Press me\n</Button>\n```\n","type":"markdown"},{"type":"separator"},{"title":"BottomNavigation","description":"Bottom navigation provides quick navigation between top-level views of an app with a bottom tab bar.\nIt is primarily designed for use on mobile.\n\n<div class=\"screenshots\">\n  <img class=\"medium\" src=\"screenshots/bottom-navigation.gif\" />\n</div>\n\n## Usage\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { BottomNavigation } from 'react-native-paper';\n\nexport default class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    index: 0,\n    routes: [\n      { key: 'music', title: 'Music', icon: 'queue-music' },\n      { key: 'albums', title: 'Albums', icon: 'album' },\n      { key: 'recents', title: 'Recents', icon: 'history' },\n    ],\n  };\n\n  _handleIndexChange = index => this.setState({ index });\n\n  _renderScene = BottomNavigation.SceneMap({\n    music: MusicRoute,\n    albums: AlbumsRoute,\n    recents: RecentsRoute,\n  });\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <BottomNavigation\n        navigationState={this.state}\n        onIndexChange={this._handleIndexChange}\n        renderScene={this._renderScene}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n```","path":"bottom-navigation","data":{"description":"Bottom navigation provides quick navigation between top-level views of an app with a bottom tab bar.\nIt is primarily designed for use on mobile.\n\n<div class=\"screenshots\">\n  <img class=\"medium\" src=\"screenshots/bottom-navigation.gif\" />\n</div>\n\n## Usage\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { BottomNavigation } from 'react-native-paper';\n\nexport default class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    index: 0,\n    routes: [\n      { key: 'music', title: 'Music', icon: 'queue-music' },\n      { key: 'albums', title: 'Albums', icon: 'album' },\n      { key: 'recents', title: 'Recents', icon: 'history' },\n    ],\n  };\n\n  _handleIndexChange = index => this.setState({ index });\n\n  _renderScene = BottomNavigation.SceneMap({\n    music: MusicRoute,\n    albums: AlbumsRoute,\n    recents: RecentsRoute,\n  });\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <BottomNavigation\n        navigationState={this.state}\n        onIndexChange={this._handleIndexChange}\n        renderScene={this._renderScene}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n}\n```","displayName":"BottomNavigation","methods":[{"name":"SceneMap","docblock":"Pure components are used to minmize re-rendering of the pages.\nThis drastically improves the animation performance.","modifiers":["static"],"params":[{"name":"scenes","type":{"name":"signature","type":"object","raw":"{ [key: string]: Function }","signature":{"properties":[{"key":{"name":"string"},"value":{"name":"Function","required":true}}]}}}],"returns":null,"description":"Pure components are used to minmize re-rendering of the pages.\nThis drastically improves the animation performance."},{"name":"_calculateShift","docblock":null,"modifiers":[],"params":[{"name":"activeIndex","type":null},{"name":"currentIndex","type":null},{"name":"numberOfItems","type":null}],"returns":null},{"name":"_handleLayout","docblock":null,"modifiers":[],"params":[{"name":"e","type":null}],"returns":null},{"name":"_handleTabPress","docblock":null,"modifiers":[],"params":[{"name":"index","type":{"name":"number"}}],"returns":null},{"name":"_jumpTo","docblock":null,"modifiers":[],"params":[{"name":"key","type":{"name":"string"}}],"returns":null}],"props":{"shifting":{"flowType":{"name":"boolean"},"required":false,"description":"Whether the shifting style is used, the active tab appears wider and the inactive tabs won't have a label.\nBy default, this is `true` when you have more than 3 tabs."},"navigationState":{"flowType":{"name":"NavigationState","elements":[{"name":"T"}],"raw":"NavigationState<T>"},"required":true,"description":"State for the bottom navigation.
