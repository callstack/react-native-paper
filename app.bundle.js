Please follow their [installation guide](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation) in order to properly use icon fonts.\n\nIf you don't want to install vector icons, you can use [babel-plugin-optional-require](https://github.com/satya164/babel-plugin-optional-require) to opt-out.\n\nIf you use Expo, you don't need to install vector icons. But if you have a `babel.config.js` or `.babelrc` file, make sure that it includes `babel-preset-expo`.\n\nTo get smaller bundle size by excluding modules you don't use, you can use our optional babel plugin. The plugin automatically rewrites the import statements so that only the modules you use are imported instead of the whole library. Add `react-native-paper/babel` to the `plugins` section in your `babel.config.js` for production environment. It should look like this:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],\n  env: {\n    production: {\n      plugins: ['react-native-paper/babel'],\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIf you created your project using Expo, it'll look something like this:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function(api) {\n  api.cache(true);\n  return {\n    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],\n    env: {\n      production: {\n        plugins: ['react-native-paper/babel'],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n};\n```\n\nThe plugin only works if you are importing the library using ES2015 import statements and not with `require`.\n\n**Note:** The above examples are for the latest `react-native` using Babel 7. If you have `react-native <= 0.55`, you'll have a `.babelrc` file instead of a `babel.config.js` file and the content of the file will be different.\n\nIf you're using Flow for typechecking your code, you need to add the following under the `[options]` section in your `.flowconfig`:\n\n```ini\nmodule.file_ext=.js\nmodule.file_ext=.native.js\nmodule.file_ext=.android.js\nmodule.file_ext=.ios.js\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nWrap your root component in `Provider` from `react-native-paper`. If you have a vanilla React Native project, it's a good idea to add it in the component which is passed to `AppRegistry.registerComponent`. This will usually be in the `index.js` file. If you have an Expo project, you can do this inside the exported component in the `App.js` file.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';\nimport { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport { name as appName } from './app.json';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => Main);\n```\n\nThe `PaperProvider` component provides the theme to all the components in the framework. It also acts as a portal to components which need to be rendered at the top level.\n\nIf you have another provider (such as `Redux`), wrap it outside `PaperProvider` so that the context is available to components rendered inside a `Modal` from the library:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport { Provider as StoreProvider } from 'react-redux';\nimport App from './src/App';\nimport store from './store';\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <StoreProvider store={store}>\n      <PaperProvider>\n        <App />\n      </PaperProvider>\n    </StoreProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can provide a custom theme to customize the colors, typescales etc. with the `Provider` component. Check the [Material Design 3 default theme](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/main/src/styles/themes/v3/LightTheme.tsx) to see what customization options are supported.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { MD3LightTheme as DefaultTheme, Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nconst theme = {\n  ...DefaultTheme,\n  colors: {\n    ...DefaultTheme.colors,\n    primary: 'tomato',\n    secondary: 'yellow',\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider theme={theme}>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n<i>Note: For MD2 check the following [Material Design 2 default theme](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/main/src/styles/themes/v2/LightTheme.tsx).</i>\n",type:"md",dependencies:[]},{filepath:"pages/10.migration-guide-to-5.0.md",title:"Introducing v5 with Material You",description:"",link:"introducing-v5-with-material-you",data:'React Native Paper v5 is all about adopting the new Material Design 3 <i>aka</i> Material You. It was released in October 2021 after intense work and effort to make Material You follow a more expressive approach to design.\n\nPaper now supports both Material Design 2 and 3 through the configuration described in [Versioning](#versioning) and is compatible with a handful of API changes. \n\n# Migration guide to Material You 5.0\n\nVersion 5.0 brings support for the next Material Design iteration branded as Material You <i>(in fact being Material Design v3 or in short MD3)</i> into the `react-native-paper` library. All the components were refined according to the official [design kit on figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460) and adjusted in terms of visuals by changes in colors, typography and animations. \n\nBelow you can find the most important information about the components whose API may have changed  API has been changed due to supporting new props, renaming existing ones or some deprecations. Hopefully, based on the presented required changes, migration to the latest version should be smooth. Enjoy!\n\n### Installation\n\n* The `v5` has been oficially released as a stable version, which means it will be installed by default from the `npm`. In order to do that, open a Terminal in your project\'s folder and run:\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-native-paper\n```\nor\n```sh\nnpm install react-native-paper\n```\n\n* From `v5` there is a need to install [react-native-safe-area-context](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context) for handling safe area.\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-native-safe-area-context\n```\nor\n```sh\nnpm install react-native-safe-area-context\n```\n\nAdditionaly for `iOS` platform there is a requirement to link the native parts of the library:\n\n```sh\nnpx pod-install\n```\n\n## Theming\n\n### Versioning\n\nIntroducing Material You <i>(MD3)</i> into `react-native-paper` doesn\'t mean dropping previous Material Design <i>(MD2)</i>! On the contrary, both of them will be supported, however, not simultaneously. To specify which design system components should follow in the app, there is a newly created property in the theme called `version` which can accept only one of two values:\n\n* <b>3</b> – <b>(default)</b> new Material You <i>(MD3)</i>,\n* <b>2</b> - previous Material Design <i>(MD2)</i>.\n\n```js\ntheme: {\n  /* ... */\n  version: 3 | 2\n}\n```\n\nRead more about using Material Design 2 in our [Material Design 2 theming guide](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html#material-design-2)\n\n### Colors\n\nNew theme introduces a new color palette along with new namings reflecting design color tokens, but written in camel case. Palette contains a set of five key colors, where primary, secondary and tertiary are classified into <i>accent colors</i>. The second group of colors is <i>neutral and neutral variant colors</i> used for defining surface or background roles as well as specifying high and medium emphasis text and icons. Additionally, the color system includes a semantic color role for error.\n\nEach accent and error colors has a group of related tones. The tones are mapped to roles that create contrast and visual interest when applied to elements in the UI.\n\n📍<i>Note: Dynamic colors are not supported yet.</i>\n\n<img class="medium" src="migration/color-palette.png" />\n\nColors theme structure should follow the default palette and contain the following properties:\n\n```js\ntheme: {\n  /* ... */\n  colors: {\n    primary,\n    primaryContainer,\n    secondary,\n    secondaryContainer,\n    tertiary,\n    tertiaryContainer,\n    surface,\n    surfaceVariant,\n    surfaceDisabled,\n    background,\n    error,\n    errorContainer,\n    onPrimary,\n    onPrimaryContainer,\n    onSecondary,\n    onSecondaryContainer,\n    onTertiary,\n    onTertiaryContainer,\n    onSurface,\n    onSurfaceVariant,\n    onSurfaceDisabled,\n    onError,\n    onErrorContainer,\n    onBackground,\n    outline,\n    shadow,\n    inverseOnSurface,\n    inverseSurface,\n    inversePrimary,\n    backdrop,\n    elevation: {\n      level0,\n      level1,\n      level2,\n      level3,\n      level4,\n      level5\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n👉 You can find more about color on [Material You website](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/the-color-system/key-colors-tones)\n\n## Typography\n\nA new way of approaching typography introduces one component `<Text>` which accepts prop `variant`. Variant defines appropriate text styles for type role and its size. The updated type scale organizes styles into five roles that are named to describe their purposes: <b>Display</b>, <b>Headline</b>, <b>Title</b>, <b>Label</b> and <b>Body</b> along with three display styles <i>large</i>, <i>medium</i>, and <i>small</i>. In total, there are fifteen variants that are MD3 compliant and are reflecting design typography tokens written in camel case. \n\n<i>Note:</i> If any component uses Paper\'s `Text` component, without specified <b>variant</b>, then `default` variant is applied.\n\n```js\n<Text variant="displayLarge">Display Large</Text>\n<Text variant="displayMedium">Display Medium</Text>\n<Text variant="displaySmall">Display small</Text>\n\n<Text variant="headlineLarge">Headline Large</Text>\n<Text variant="headlineMedium">Headline Medium</Text>\n<Text variant="headlineSmall">Headline Small</Text>\n\n<Text variant="titleLarge">Title Large</Text>\n<Text variant="titleMedium">Title Medium</Text>\n<Text variant="titleSmall">Title Small</Text>\n\n<Text variant="bodyLarge">Body Large</Text>\n<Text variant="bodyMedium">Body Medium</Text>\n<Text variant="bodySmall">Body Small</Text>\n\n<Text variant="labelLarge">Label Large</Text>\n<Text variant="labelMedium">Label Medium</Text>\n<Text variant="labelSmall">Label Small</Text>\n ```\n\nTake a look at the suggested replacement diff:\n\n ```diff\n- <Headline>Headline</Headline>\n+ <Text variant="headlineSmall">Headline</Text>\n\n- <Title>Title</Title>\n+ <Text variant="titleLarge">Title</Text>\n\n- <Subheading>Subheading</Subheading>\n+ <Text variant="titleMedium">Subheading</Text>\n\n- <Paragraph>Paragraph</Paragraph>\n+ <Text variant="bodyMedium">Paragraph</Text>\n\n- <Caption>Caption</Caption>\n+ <Text variant="bodySmall">Caption</Text>\n ```\n\n\n👉 You can find more about color on [Material You website](https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/overview)\n\n### Configure fonts\n\nThe existing utility called `configureFonts` was adjusted to help users configure their theme fonts in both version, that\'s why that function, as of today, is going to accept the object with the follwing properties as an argument:\n\n```ts\nconfigureFonts(params)\n```\n\n<b>Parameters:</b>\n\n| NAME        | TYPE        | REQUIRED    |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| params      | object      | No          |\n\nValid `params` keys are:\n\n  * `config` ([MD2FontsConfig](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/main/src/styles/fonts.tsx#L63) | [MD3FontsConfig](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/main/src/styles/fonts.tsx#L67)) - fonts config object appropriate to the MD version\n  * `isV3` (boolean) - whether adjusting theme fonts for v3. Default it <b>true</b>.\n\nTo use your current font config from <b>v2</b> and migrate to <b>v3</b> there are two requirements:\n* the font config previously passed directly into function has to be passed into the params object property called `config`\n* the params object property `isV3` has to be set to `false`\n\n```diff\n- configureFonts(fontConfig)\n+ configureFonts({config: fontConfig, isV3: false})\n```\n\n📍<i>Note: If you want to check how to use `configureFonts` on MD3, check the [Fonts](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/fonts.html) guide.</i>\n\n# Components\n\n## Appbar <i>(Top app bar)</i>\n\n`Appbar` and `Appbar.Header` in the latest version can be used in four various modes due to new prop `mode`:\n\n* `small` - Appbar with default height <i>(56) (default)</i>,\n* `medium` - Appbar with medium height <i>(112)</i>,\n* `large` - Appbar with large height <i>(152)</i>,\n* `center-aligned` - Appbar with default height <i>(56)</i> and center-aligned title.\n\n```js\n<Appbar mode="center-aligned">\n  /* ... */\n</Appbar>\n```\n\nTo make it easier for users to build the `BottomBar`, formed on the `Appbar` components, we have added a property `safeAreaInsets`:\n\n```js\n<Appbar safeAreaInsets={{ bottom: 47 }}>\n  /* ... */\n</Appbar>\n```\n \nIt\'s worth noting that by default the theme version 3 `Appbar` and `Appbar.Header` don\'t have a shadow. However, it can be added by passing prop `elevated` into the component:\n\n```js\n<Appbar elevated>\n  /* ... */\n</Appbar>\n```\n\n### Appbar.Action\n\n`Appbar.Action` received new prop `isLeading`, which defines whether it\'s the <b>leading</b> button and should be placed at the beginning of the `Appbar`.\n\n```js\n<Appbar.Action isLeading icon="magnify" onPress={() => {}} />\n```\n\n### Appbar.Content\n\nNew design guidelines indicate there is no <b>subtitle</b> in `Appbar.Content`, that\'s why there are two deprecations and the following props won\'t be supported anymore: `subtitle` and `subtitleStyle`.\n\n```diff\n- <Appbar.Content title="Title" subtitle="Subtitle" styles={styles.subtitle} />\n+ <Appbar.Content title="Title" />\n```\n\n## Banner, Searchbar and Snackbar\n\nAccording to the updates in `Surface` on the top of which `Banner`, `Searchbar` and `Snackbar` are implemented, all three component received `elevation` prop to adjust its value.\n\n```diff\n- <Snackbar style={{elevation: 1}}>Hello</Snackbar>\n+ <Snackbar elevation={1}>Hello</Snackbar>\n```\n\n## BottomNavigation <i>(Navigation bar)</i>\n\nFor the sake of new animation of pill shape, indicating active destination, and assisting icon change from outlined to filled, there are three changes within `navigationState.routes` property items:\n\n* `color` is deprecated since color is constant and the same for all routes,\n* `icon` is renamed to `focusedIcon`, as the name implies, with theme version 3 it\'s the outline icon used as focused tab icon and with theme version 2 it\'s a default icon,\n* `unfocusedIcon` <i>(optional)</i> is the filled icon used as the unfocused tab icon, compatible with theme version 3.\n\n📍<i>Note: `unfocusedIcon` is optional, if you can\'t find outline icon equivalent, omit that prop, so `focusedIcon` will be displayed in both active and inactive state</i>\n\n```diff\nroutes: [\n- { key: "album", title: "Album", icon: "image-album", color: "#3F51B5" },\n+ { key: "album", title: "Album", focusedIcon: "image-album" },\n- { key: "library", title: "Library", icon: "inbox", color: "#009688" },\n+ { key: "library", title: "Library", focusedIcon: "inbox", unfocusedIcon: "inbox-outline" },\n- { key: "favorites", title: "Favorites", icon: "heart", color: "#795548" },\n+ { key: "favorites", title: "Favorites", focusedIcon: "heart", unfocusedIcon: "heart-outline; },\n- { key: "purchased", title: "Purchased", icon: "shopping-cart", color: "#607D8B" },\n+ { key: "purchased", title: "Purchased", focusedIcon: "shopping-cart" },\n]\n```\n\nThe `compact` prop was also introduced, working with both themes. It indicates whether tabs should be spread across the entire width, especially in a <i>horizontal</i> mode. \n\n```js\n<BottomNavigation compact />\n```\n\nIt\'s worth to mention that default value of prop `shifting` depends on the theme version:\n* <b>3</b> - it\'s `false`,\n* <b>2</b> - it\'s `true` when there are more than 3 tabs.\n\nTwo additional props that control the scene animation were introduced that control the animation of the tabs when `sceneAnimationEnabled` is `true`:\n* `sceneAnimationType: "opacity" | "shifting" | undefined` - defines the animation type for the scene. `shifting` enables a new animation where navigating to a scene will shift it horizontally into view. Both `opacity` and `undefined` have the same effect, fading the scene into view.\n* `sceneAnimationEasing` allows specifying a custom easing function for the scene animation.\n\n![shiftingAnimation](screenshots/bottom-navigation-shifting.gif)\n\nOn a final note, please be aware that `BottomNavigation` with theme version 3 doesn\'t have a shadow.\n\n## Button\n\n`Button`\'s property `mode` has been expanded with two additional options:\n* `elevated` - button with a background color and elevation, used when absolutely necessary e.g. button requires visual separation from a patterned background,\n* `container-tonal` - button with a secondary background color, an alternative middle ground between contained and outlined buttons.\n\n```js\n<>\n  <Button icon="camera" mode="elevated" onPress={onPress}>\n    Elevated\n  </Button>\n  <Button icon="camera" mode="container-tonal" onPress={onPress}>\n    Container tonal\n  </Button>\n</>\n```\n\nThe property `color` is deprecated, but in its place two new props called `buttonColor` and `textColor` are introduced:\n* `buttonColor` - custom button\'s background color,\n* `textColor` - custom button\'s text color.\n\n```diff\n- <Button mode="text" color="red" onPress={onPress}>Custom text color</Button>\n+ <Button mode="text" textColor="red" onPress={onPress}>Custom text color</Button>\n```\n\n```diff\n- <Button mode="contained" color="red" onPress={onPress}>Custom text color</Button>\n+ <Button mode="contained" buttonColor="red" onPress={onPress}>Custom background color</Button>\n```\n\nPlease be aware that along with theme version 3, by default text in the `Button` component isn\'t uppercased and `contained` button doesn\'t have any shadow <i>(use then `elevated`)</i>.\n\n## Card\n\nThe `Card` component\'s property `mode` has been expanded with one additional option called `contained`, which applies to the card\'s specified background color without any elevation and border.\n\n```js\n<Card mode="contained" />\n```\n\n## Card.Title\n\nSince there is no one right way to make a card, there is also no one right way for specifying a title and subtitle variant. Therefore two new props come in handy:\n\n* `titleVariant` - title text variant defines appropriate text styles for type role and its size.\n* `subtitleVariant` - subtitle text variant defines appropriate text styles for type role and its size.\n\n```js\n<Card.Title\n  titleVariant="headlineMedium"\n  subtitleVariant="bodyLarge"\n/>\n```\n\n## Checkbox.Item\n\n`Checkbox.Item` similarly to `RadioButton.Item` has been expanded with the prop called `labelVariant`, which defines appropriate text styles for type role and its size.\n\n```js\n<Checkbox.Item \n  labelVariant="titleLarge"\n>\n```\n\n## Chip\n\nTo properly compose `Chip` component and adjust into required type, there are three new props that will come in handy:\n\n* `compact` - sets smaller horizontal paddings around the label, useful for `Chip` containing only the label,\n* `elevated` - indicating whether `Chip` should be elevated,\n* `showSelectedOverlay` - defining whether to display an overlay on a selected button.\n\n```js\n<>\n  <Chip compact>Compact Chip</Chip>\n  <Chip icon="camera" elevated>Elevated Chip</Chip>\n  <Chip icon="camera" selected showSelectedOverlay>Chip with selected overlay</Chip>\n</>\n```\n\n## Dialog.Icon\n\n`Dialog.Icon` is another freshly added component presenting an icon within a `Dialog`, placed at the top of the content.\n\n📍<i>Note: It\'s working only with theme version 3.</i>\n\n```js\n<Portal>\n  <Dialog visible={visible} onDismiss={hideDialog}>\n    <Dialog.Icon icon="alert" />\n  </Dialog>\n</Portal>\n```\n## Divider\n\n`Divider` component received two new props:\n\n* `bold` - divider is bolded,\n* `horizontalInset` - divider has horizontal insets on both sides.\n\nAdditionally prop `inset` was renamed to `leftInset`.\n\n```diff\n- <Divider inset />\n+ <Divider leftInset />\n```\n\n## Drawer.CollapsedItem <i>(Navigation rail)</i>\n\n`Drawer.CollapsedItem` is a newly created side navigation component that can be used within `Drawer`, representing a destination in the form of an action item with an icon and optionally label.\n\n📍<i>Note: It\'s working only with theme version 3.</i>\n\n```js\n<Drawer.Section>\n  <Drawer.CollapsedItem\n    focusedIcon="inbox"\n    unfocusedIcon="inbox-outline"\n    label="Inbox"\n  />\n  <Drawer.CollapsedItem\n    focusedIcon="star"\n    unfocusedIcon="star-outline"\n    label="Starred"\n  />\n</Drawer.Section>\n```\n\n## Drawer.Section\n\nWith the latest version, there is a possibility to specify whether `Drawer.Section` should have a separator, in form of `Divider` component, displayed at the end of the section. To adjust it, a new property called `showDivider` was introduced, which by default is `true`:\n\n```js\n<Drawer.Section showDivider={false}>\n  <Drawer.CollapsedItem\n    focusedIcon="inbox"\n    unfocusedIcon="inbox-outline"\n    label="Inbox"\n  />\n  <Drawer.CollapsedItem\n    focusedIcon="star"\n    unfocusedIcon="star-outline"\n    label="Starred"\n  />\n</Drawer.Section>\n```\n\n## Floating Action Buttons\n\n`FAB`, `AnimatedFAB` and `FAB.Group` in the latest version can be used with four variants and two modes, thanks to two new props:\n\n* `variant` defines color mappings variant for combinations of container and icon colors. Can be one of: <b>primary</b> <i>(default)</i>, <b>secondary</b>, <b>tertiary</b> or <b>surface</b>.\n\n```js\n<FAB variant="tertiary" />\n```\n\n* `mode` specifies whether a button should be <b>flat</b> or <b>elevated</b>:\n   - `flat` - button without a shadow,\n   - `elevated` - button with a shadow.\n\n```js\n<FAB mode="flat" />\n```\n\n### FAB\n\nAdditionaly `FAB` may be applied in one of three available sizes, thanks to new prop `size`: \n\n* `small` - FAB with small height (40),\n* `medium` - Appbar with default medium height (56),\n* `large` - Appbar with large height (96).\n\n```js\n<FAB size="large" />\n```\n\nHowever, if you would like to have your own size of `FAB`, there is a new prop called `customSize`:\n\n```js\n<FAB customSize={64}>\n```\n\nAccordingly to introducing `size="small"`, prop `small` was deprecated.\n\n```diff\n- <FAB small />\n+ <FAB size="small" />\n```\n\n### FAB.Group\n\nThere is also deprecation in one of the `actions` properties, namely `small` prop is deprecated and replaced in favour of the default `size="small"`.\n\n```diff\n- <FAB.Group actions={[{ icon: "plus", small }]} />\n+ <FAB.Group actions={[{ icon: "plus" }]} />\n```\n\nAdditionally, the action item property previously known as `labelStyle` was renamed to `containerStyle` since it\'s tied mostly with the container styles. At the same time, `labelStyle` is still available with the new role related to styling item label. \n\n```diff\n- <FAB.Group actions={[{ icon: "plus", labelStyle: styles.customStyle }]} />\n+ <FAB.Group actions={[{ icon: "plus", containerStyle: styles.customStyle, labelStyle: styles.newLabelStyle }]} />\n```\n\n## IconButton\n\n`IconButton` received two new props:\n\n* `selected` sets alternative combination of icon and container color,\n\n```js\n<IconButton selected>\n```\n\n* `containerColor` custom background color of the icon container. \n\n```js\n<IconButton containerColor="red">\n```\n\nAt the same time, the `color` prop was renamed to `iconColor`.\n\n```diff\n- <IconButton color="red" />\n+ <IconButton iconColor="red" />\n```\n\n## Menu.Item\n\n`Menu.Item` received two new props:\n\n* `dense` sets smaller item height for more condensed layout,\n* `trailingIcon` which handles displaying an icon at the end of the item row. \n\n```js\n<Menu.Item dense trailingIcon="chevron-up">\n```\n\nAt the same time, by analogy to the second new prop, the `icon` prop was renamed to `leadingIcon`.\n\n```diff\n- <Menu.Item icon="redo" onPress={() => {}} title="Redo" />\n+ <Menu.Item leadingIcon="redo" onPress={() => {}} title="Redo" />\n```\n\n## RadioButton.Item\n\n`RadioButton.Item` has been expanded with the prop called `labelVariant`, which defines appropriate text styles for type role and its size.\n\n```js\n<RadioButton.Item \n  labelVariant="titleLarge"\n>\n```\n\n## SegmentedButtons\n\n`SegmentedButtons` is a completely new component introduced in the latest version. It allows people to select options, switch views, or sort elements. It supports single and multiselect select variant and provide a lot of customization options.\n\n![segmentedButtons](screenshots/segmentedbuttons.gif)\n\n```js\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(\'\');\n\n  return (\n      <SegmentedButtons\n        value={value}\n        onValueChange={setValue}\n        buttons={[\n          {\n            value: \'walk\',\n            label: \'Walking\',\n          },\n          {\n            value: \'train\',\n            label: \'Transit\',\n          },\n          {\n            value: \'drive\',\n            label: \'Driving\',\n          },\n        ]}\n      />\n  );\n};\n```\n\n## Snackbar\n\n`Snackbar` due to the optional close affordance, in form of `IconButton` <i>(located on the right side of action button)</i>, received three new props:\n\n* `icon` - icon to display when `onIconPress` is defined. Default will be `close` icon.\n* `onIconPress` - function to execute on icon button press. The icon button appears only when this prop is specified.\n* `iconAccessibilityLabel` - accessibility label for the icon button.\n\n## Surface\n\n`Surface` component received one new prop:\n* `elevation` - accepts values from `0` to `5` and applies background color and shadows to the `Surface` component. Supports both iOS and Android.\n\nPreviously `elevation` was passed inside the `style` prop. Since it supported not only Android, but also iOS, we decided to extract it from `style` and create a separate `elevation` prop for that.\n\n```diff\n- <Surface style={{ elevation: 1 }} />\n+ <Surface elevation={1} />\n```\n\n## TextInput.Icon\n\nThe property `name` was renamed to `icon`, since the scope and type of that prop is much wider than just the icon name – it accepts also the function which receives an object with color and size properties and \n\n```diff\n- <TextInput.Icon name="magnify" />\n+ <TextInput.Icon icon="magnify" />\n```\n\n## Tooltip\n\nComponent displayed upon tapping and holding a screen element or component used to present an informative text label identifying an element, such as a description of its function.\n\n![tooltip](screenshots/tooltips.gif)\n\n\n```js\n<Tooltip title="Selected Camera">\n  <IconButton icon="camera" selected size={24} onPress={() => {}} />\n</Tooltip>\n```\n\n## Credits\n\n<i>With this, that’s a wrap.</i>\n\nThe update wouldn\'t happen without a group of great React Native experts I\'m happy to work with. \nFrom this place I would like to thank:\n- [Daniel Szczepanik](https://github.com/Drakeoon) for his commitment, effort and collaborative work on adjusting components,\n- [Olimpia Zurek](https://github.com/OlimpiaZurek) for her contribution and help,\n- [Aleksandra Desmurs-Linczewska](https://github.com/p-syche), [Jan Jaworek](https://github.com/jaworek) and [Kewin Wereszczyński](https://github.com/kwereszczynski) for checking and testing changes as well as providing valuable feedback,\n- [Bruno Castro](https://github.com/brunohkbx) for creating a long-awaited `Tooltip` component,\n- [Muhammad Hur Ali](https://github.com/hurali97) for various bug fixes and `List` subcomponents adjustments,\n\nand, <i>last but not least</i>, [Satya Sahoo](https://github.com/satya164) for his mentoring during the process.\n',type:"md",dependencies:[]},function(){var e=n("./node_modules/react/index.js"),t=n("./node_modules/component-docs/dist/templates/Content.js").default,o={exports:{}},a={react:n("./node_modules/react/index.js"),"@mdx-js/tag":n("./node_modules/@mdx-js/tag/dist/index.js"),"./src/components/DynamicColorTheme.js":n("./pages/src/components/DynamicColorTheme.js")};!function(e,t,n,o,a){"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),t.default=t.meta=void 0;var r,s=function(e){if(e&&e.__esModule)return e;if(null===e||"object"!==u(e)&&"function"!=typeof e)return{default:e};var t=c();if(t&&t.has(e))return t.get(e);var n={},o=Object.defineProperty&&Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;for(var a in e)if(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,a)){var r=o?Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,a):null;r&&(r.get||r.set)?Object.defineProperty(n,a,r):n[a]=e[a]}n.default=e,t&&t.set(e,n);return n}(n("react")),i=n("@mdx-js/tag"),l=(r=n("./src/components/DynamicColorTheme.js"))&&r.__esModule?r:{default:r};function c(){if("function"!=typeof WeakMap)return null;var e=new WeakMap;return c=function(){return e},e}function u(e){return(u="function"==typeof Symbol&&"symbol"==typeof Symbol.iterator?function(e){return typeof e}:function(e){return e&&"function"==typeof Symbol&&e.constructor===Symbol&&e!==Symbol.prototype?"symbol":typeof e})(e)}function p(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,o,a=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,o,a={},r=Object.keys(e);for(o=0;o<r.length;o++)n=r[o],t.indexOf(n)>=0||(a[n]=e[n]);return a}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var r=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(o=0;o<r.length;o++)n=r[o],t.indexOf(n)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,n)&&(a[n]=e[n])}return a}function d(e,t){for(var n=0;n<t.length;n++){var o=t[n];o.enumerable=o.enumerable||!1,o.configurable=!0,"value"in o&&(o.writable=!0),Object.defineProperty(e,o.key,o)}}function m(e,t){return(m=Object.setPrototypeOf||function(e,t){return e.__proto__=t,e})(e,t)}function h(e){var t=function(){if("undefined"==typeof Reflect||!Reflect.construct)return!1;if(Reflect.construct.sham)return!1;if("function"==typeof Proxy)return!0;try{return Date.prototype.toString.call(Reflect.construct(Date,[],(function(){}))),!0}catch(e){return!1}}();return function(){var n,o=g(e);if(t){var a=g(this).constructor;n=Reflect.construct(o,arguments,a)}else n=o.apply(this,arguments);return f(this,n)}}function f(e,t){return!t||"object"!==u(t)&&"function"!=typeof t?function(e){if(void 0===e)throw new ReferenceError("this hasn't been initialised -

Web",description:"",link:"using-on-the-web",data:'# Using on the Web\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\nMake sure that you have followed the getting started guide and have `react-native-paper` installed and configured before following this guide.\n\nWe\'re going to use [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to use React Native Paper on the web, so let\'s install them as well.\n\nTo install `react-native-web`, run:\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-native-web react-dom react-art\n```\n\n### Using CRA ([Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))\n\nInstall [`react-app-rewired`](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) to override `webpack` configuration:\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev react-app-rewired\n```\n\n[Configure `babel-loader`](#2-configure-babel-loader) using a new file called `config-overrides.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function override(config, env) {\n  config.module.rules.push({\n    test: /\\.js$/,\n    exclude: /node_modules[/\\\\](?!react-native-vector-icons)/,\n    use: {\n      loader: "babel-loader",\n      options: {\n        // Disable reading babel configuration\n        babelrc: false,\n        configFile: false,\n\n        // The configuration for compilation\n        presets: [\n          ["@babel/preset-env", { useBuiltIns: "usage" }],\n          "@babel/preset-react",\n          "@babel/preset-flow",\n          "@babel/preset-typescript"\n        ],\n        plugins: [\n          "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties",\n          "@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  return config;\n};\n```\n\nChange your script in `package.json`:\n\n```diff\n/* package.json */\n\n  "scripts": {\n-   "start": "react-scripts start",\n+   "start": "react-app-rewired start",\n-   "build": "react-scripts build",\n+   "build": "react-app-rewired build",\n-   "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",\n+   "test": "react-app-rewired test --env=jsdom"\n}\n```\n\n### Custom webpack setup\n\nTo install `webpack`, run:\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nIf you don\'t have a webpack config in your project, copy the following to `webpack.config.js` get started:\n\n```js\nconst path = require(\'path\');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: \'development\',\n\n  // Path to the entry file, change it according to the path you have\n  entry: path.join(__dirname, \'App.js\'),\n\n  // Path for the output files\n  output: {\n    path: path.join(__dirname, \'dist\'),\n    filename: \'app.bundle.js\',\n  },\n\n  // Enable source map support\n  devtool: \'source-map\',\n\n  // Loaders and resolver config\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n\n    ],\n  },\n  resolve: {\n\n  },\n\n  // Development server config\n  devServer: {\n    contentBase: [path.join(__dirname, \'public\')],\n    historyApiFallback: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\nAlso create a folder named `public` and add the following file named `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<head>\n  <meta charSet="utf-8" />\n  <meta httpEquiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />\n\n  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1" />\n\n  <title>App</title>\n\n  <style>\n    html, body, #root {\n      height: 100%;\n    }\n\n    #root {\n      display: flex;\n      flex-direction: column;\n    }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div id="root"></div>\n  <script src="app.bundle.js"><\/script>\n</body>\n```\n\nNow we\'re ready to start configuring the project.\n\n## Configure webpack\n\n### 1. Alias `react-native` to `react-native-web`\n\nFirst, we have to tell webpack to use `react-native-web` instead of `react-native`. Add the following alias in your webpack config under `resolve`:\n\n```js\nalias: {\n  \'react-native$\': require.resolve(\'react-native-web\'),\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Configure `babel-loader`\n\nNext, we want to tell `babel-loader` to compile `react-native-paper` and `react-native-vector-icons`. We would also want to disable reading the babel configuration files to prevent any conflicts.\n\nFirst install the required dependencies:\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-flow @babel/preset-typescript @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread\n```\n\nNow, add the following in the `module.rules` array in your webpack config:\n\n```js\n{\n  test: /\\.js$/,\n  exclude: /node_modules[/\\\\](?!react-native-vector-icons)/,\n  use: {\n    loader: \'babel-loader\',\n    options: {\n      // Disable reading babel configuration\n      babelrc: false,\n      configFile: false,\n\n      // The configuration for compilation\n      presets: [\n        [\'@babel/preset-env\', { useBuiltIns: \'usage\' }],\n        \'@babel/preset-react\',\n        \'@babel/preset-flow\',\n        "@babel/preset-typescript"\n      ],\n      plugins: [\n        \'@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties\',\n        \'@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread\'\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n},\n```\n\n### 3. Configure `file-loader`\n\n#### webpack < 5.0\n\nTo be able to import images and other assets using `require`, we need to configure `file-loader`. Let\'s install it:\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev file-loader\n```\n\nTo configure it, add the following in the `module.rules` array in your webpack config:\n\n```js\n{\n  test: /\\.(jpg|png|woff|woff2|eot|ttf|svg)$/,\n  loader: \'file-loader\',\n}\n```\n\n##### webpack >= 5.0\n\nUse `asset/resource`, since `file-loader` was deprecated in webpack v5.\n\n```js\n{\n  test: /\\.(jpg|png|woff|woff2|eot|ttf|svg)$/,\n  type: \'asset/resource\'\n}\n```\n\n## Load the Material Community Icons\n\nIf you followed the getting started guide, you should have the following code in your root component:\n\n```js\n<PaperProvider>\n  <App />\n</PaperProvider>\n```\n\nNow we need tweak this section to load the Material Community Icons from the [`react-native-vector-icons`](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) library:\n\n```js\n<PaperProvider>\n  <React.Fragment>\n    {Platform.OS === \'web\' ? (\n      <style type="text/css">{`\n        @font-face {\n          font-family: \'MaterialCommunityIcons\';\n          src: url(${require(\'react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/MaterialCommunityIcons.ttf\')}) format(\'truetype\');\n        }\n      `}</style>\n    ) : null}\n    <App />\n  </React.Fragment>\n</PaperProvider>\n```\n\nRemember to import `Platform` from `react-native` at the top:\n\n```js\nimport { Platform } from \'react-native\';\n```\n\nYou can also load these fonts using [`css-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) if you prefer.\n\n## Load the Roboto fonts (optional)\n\nThe default theme in React Native Paper uses the Roboto font. You can add them to your project following [the instructions on its Google Fonts page](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?selection.family=Roboto:100,300,400,500).\n\n## We\'re done!\n\nYou can run `webpack-dev-server` to run the webpack server and open your project in the browser. You can add the following script in your `package.json` under the `"scripts"` section to make it easier:\n\n```json\n"web": "webpack-dev-server --open"\n```\n\nNow you can run `yarn web` to run the project on web.\n',type:"md",dependencies:[]},{filepath:"pages/6.recommended-libraries.md",title:"Recommended Libraries",description:"",link:"recommended-libraries",data:"# Recommended Libraries\n\nOur mission is to provide a full suite of well-integrated components built with Material Design in mind.

Please read [the full text](https://callstack.com/code-of-conduct/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=react-native-paper&utm_term=code-of-conduct) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\n\n## Our Development Process\n\nThe core team works directly on GitHub and all work is public.\n\n### Development workflow\n\n> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this *free* series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).\n\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main` (a guide on [how to fork a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)).\n2. Run `yarn bootstrap` on the root level, to setup the development environment.\n3. Do the changes you want and test them out in the example app before sending a pull request.\n\n### Commit message convention\n\nWe follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:\n\n* `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix Button color on DarkTheme.\n* `feat`: new features, e.g. add Snackbar component.\n* `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. new folder structure for components.\n* `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for Button.\n* `test`: adding or updating tests, eg unit, snapshot testing.\n* `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change circleci config.\n* `BREAKING CHANGE`: for changes that break existing usage, e.g. change API of a component.\n\nOur pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.\n\n### Linting and tests\n\nWe use `typescript` for type checking, `eslint` with `prettier` for linting and formatting the code, and `jest` for testing. Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter and tests pass when commiting. You can also run the following commands manually:\n\n* `yarn typescript`: type-check files with `tsc`.\n* `yarn lint`: lint files with `eslint` and `prettier`.\n* `yarn test`: run unit tests with `jest`.\n\n### Sending a pull request\n\nWhen you're sending a pull request:\n\n* Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.\n* Verify that `typescript`, `eslint` and all tests are passing.\n* Preview the documentation to make sure it looks good.\n* Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.\n\nWhen you're working on a component:\n\n* Follow the guidelines described in the [official material design docs](https://material.io/guidelines/).\n* Write a brief description of every prop when defining `type Props` to aid with documentation.\n* Provide an example usage for the component (check other components to get a idea).\n* Update the type definitions for Flow and TypeScript if you changed an API or added a component.\n\n### Running the example\n\nThe example app uses [Expo](https://expo.dev/) for the React Native example. You will need to install the Expo app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) to start developing.\n\nAfter you're done, you can run `yarn example start` in the project root (or `expo start` in the `example/` folder) and scan the QR code to launch it on your device.\n\nTo run the example on web, run `yarn example web` in the project root.\n\n### Working on documentation\n\nThe documentation is automatically generated from the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) annotations in the components. You can add comments above the type annotations to add descriptions. To preview the generated documentation, run `yarn docs start` in the project root.\n\n### Publishing a release\n\nWe use [release-it](https://github.com/webpro/release-it) to automate our release. If you have publish access to the NPM package, run the following from the main branch to publish a new release:\n\n```sh\nyarn release\n```\n\nNOTE: You must have a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable available. You can create a GitHub access token with the \"repo\" access [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nYou can report issues on our [bug tracker](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/issues).

It's possible to import them in light and dark variants from both.\n\n```js\nimport {\n  DarkTheme as NavigationDarkTheme,\n  DefaultTheme as NavigationDefaultTheme,\n} from '@react-navigation/native';\n\nimport {\n  MD2LightTheme,\n  MD2DarkTheme,\n} from 'react-native-paper';\n```\n\n### Material Design 3\n\nFrom v5, React Native Paper theme colors structure is following the Material Design 3 <i>(known as Material You)</i> colors system, which differs significantly from both previous Paper's theme and React Navigation theme. \n\nHowever, to simplify adapting React Navigation theme colors, to use the ones from React Native Paper, it's worth using a utility called `adaptNavigationTheme` – it accepts navigation compliant themes in both modes and returns their equivalents adjusted to Material Design 3.\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  DarkTheme as NavigationDarkTheme,\n  DefaultTheme as NavigationDefaultTheme,\n} from '@react-navigation/native';\n\nconst { LightTheme, DarkTheme } = adaptNavigationTheme({\n  reactNavigationLight: NavigationDefaultTheme,\n  reactNavigationDark: NavigationDarkTheme,\n});\n```\n\nLibrary exports also Material Design 3 themes in both modes:\n\n```js\nimport {\n  MD3LightTheme,\n  MD3DarkTheme,\n} from 'react-native-paper';\n```\n\n## Combining theme objects\n\nBoth libraries require a wrapper to be used at the entry point of the application.\nReact Navigation exposes `NavigationContainer` which ensures that navigation works correctly, but also accepts `theme` as an optional property. Read more about setting up navigation [here](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/).\nFor React Native Paper theme to work, we need to use `PaperProvider` also at application's entry point.\n\n```js\nimport { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';\nimport { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';\nimport { TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';\nimport {\n  Card,\n  Title,\n  Paragraph,\n  List,\n  Provider as PaperProvider,\n} from 'react-native-paper';\n\nconst Stack = createStackNavigator();\n\nconst HomeScreen = ({ navigation }) => (\n  <TouchableOpacity\n    onPress={() =>\n      navigation?.push('Details', {\n        title,\n        content,\n      })\n    }\n  >\n    <Card>\n      <Card.Content>\n        <Title>{title}</Title>\n        <Paragraph>{content}</Paragraph>\n      </Card.Content>\n    </Card>\n  </TouchableOpacity>\n);\n\nconst DetailsScreen = (props) => {\n  const { title, content } = props?.route?.params;\n  return (\n    <List.Section>\n      <List.Subheader>{title}</List.Subheader>\n      <List.Item title={content} />\n    </List.Section>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider>\n      <NavigationContainer>\n        <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName=\"Home\">\n          <Stack.Screen name=\"Home\" component={HomeScreen} />\n          <Stack.Screen name=\"Details\" component={DetailsScreen} />\n        </Stack.Navigator>\n      </NavigationContainer>\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n\n\nOur goal here is to combine those two themes, so that we could control the theme for the entire application from a single place.\n\nTo make things easier we can use [deepmerge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepmerge) package. With `yarn` we can install it like this\n\n```sh\nyarn add deepmerge\n```\n\n### Material Design 2\n\n```js\nimport {\n  NavigationContainer,\n  DarkTheme as NavigationDarkTheme,\n  DefaultTheme as NavigationDefaultTheme,\n} from '@react-navigation/native';\nimport {\n  MD2DarkTheme,\n  MD2LightTheme,\n} from 'react-native-paper';\nimport merge from 'deepmerge';\n\nconst CombinedDefaultTheme = merge(MD2LightTheme, NavigationDefaultTheme);\nconst CombinedDarkTheme = merge(MD2DarkTheme, NavigationDarkTheme);\n```\n\n### Material Design 3\n\n```js\nimport {\n  NavigationContainer,\n  DarkTheme as NavigationDarkTheme,\n  DefaultTheme as NavigationDefaultTheme,\n} from '@react-navigation/native';\nimport {\n  MD3DarkTheme,\n  MD3LightTheme,\n} from 'react-native-paper';\nimport merge from 'deepmerge';\n\nconst { LightTheme, DarkTheme } = adaptNavigationTheme({\n  reactNavigationLight: NavigationDefaultTheme,\n  reactNavigationDark: NavigationDarkTheme,\n});\n\nconst CombinedDefaultTheme = merge(MD3LightTheme, LightTheme);\nconst CombinedDarkTheme = merge(MD3DarkTheme, DarkTheme);\n```\n\nAlternatively, we could merge those themes using vanilla JavaScript:\n\n### Material Design 2\n\n```js\nconst CombinedDefaultTheme = {\n  ...MD2LightTheme,\n  ...NavigationDefaultTheme,\n  colors: {\n    ...MD2LightTheme.colors,\n    ...NavigationDefaultTheme.colors,\n  },\n};\nconst CombinedDarkTheme = {\n  ...MD2DarkTheme,\n  ...NavigationDarkTheme,\n  colors: {\n    ...MD2DarkTheme.colors,\n    ...NavigationDarkTheme.colors,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Material Design 3\n\n```js\nconst { LightTheme, DarkTheme } = adaptNavigationTheme({\n  reactNavigationLight: NavigationDefaultTheme,\n  reactNavigationDark: NavigationDarkTheme,\n});\n\nconst CombinedDefaultTheme = {\n  ...MD3LightTheme,\n  ...LightTheme,\n  colors: {\n    ...MD3LightTheme.colors,\n    ...LightTheme.colors,\n  },\n};\nconst CombinedDarkTheme = {\n  ...MD3DarkTheme,\n  ...DarkTheme,\n  colors: {\n    ...MD3DarkTheme.colors,\n    ...DarkTheme.colors,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n## Passing theme with Providers\n\nAfter combining the themes, we will be able to control theming in both libraries from a single source, which will come in handy later.\n\nNext, we need to pass merged themes into the Providers. For this part, we use the dark one - `CombinedDarkTheme`.\n\n```js\nconst Stack = createStackNavigator();\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider theme={CombinedDarkTheme}>\n      <NavigationContainer theme={CombinedDarkTheme}>\n        <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName=\"Home\">\n          <Stack.Screen name=\"Home\" component={HomeScreen} />\n          <Stack.Screen name=\"Details\" component={DetailsScreen} />\n        </Stack.Navigator>\n      </NavigationContainer>\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Customizing theme\n\nWe don't need to limit ourselves to the themes offered by the libraries in default. Both packages allow for custom themes to be applied.\nYou can learn all about it their documentations:\n\n- [Theming in React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/themes/)\n- [Theming in React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html)\n\n## React Context for theme customization\n\nNow, we wouldn't want to stay forever with dark theme being on, which is why we need to gain the ability to control theme dynamically. A bit of state management is needed for this purpose.\n\nReact Context proves itself very useful in handling cross-cutting concerns like global theme handling, so we will use just that.\n\n## Creating Context\n\nFirst, we define our Context.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nexport const PreferencesContext = React.createContext({\n  toggleTheme: () => {},\n  isThemeDark: false,\n});\n```\n\n## Using Context\n\nContext Provider should be imported also at the entry point, as we want it to wrap the whole app, for the theme values to be accessible at every component that we have.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { PreferencesContext } from './PreferencesContext';\n\nconst Stack = createStackNavigator();\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [isThemeDark, setIsThemeDark] = React.useState(false);\n\n  let theme = isThemeDark ? CombinedDarkTheme : CombinedDefaultTheme;\n\n  const toggleTheme = React.useCallback(() => {\n    return setIsThemeDark(!isThemeDark);\n  }, [isThemeDark]);\n\n  const preferences = React.useMemo(\n    () => ({\n      toggleTheme,\n      isThemeDark,\n    }),\n    [toggleTheme, isThemeDark]\n  );\n\n  return (\n    // Context is wired into the local state of our main component, so that its values could be propagated throughout the entire application\n    <PreferencesContext.Provider value={preferences}>\n      <PaperProvider theme={theme}>\n        <NavigationContainer theme={theme}>\n          <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName=\"Home\">\n            <Stack.Screen name=\"Home\" component={HomeScreen} />\n            <Stack.Screen name=\"Details\" component={DetailsScreen} />\n          </Stack.Navigator>\n        </NavigationContainer>\n      </PaperProvider>\n    </PreferencesContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNow that the Context is available at every component, all we need to do is import it. Next thing is to provide the user with some UI element to control changing the theme. We will use `Paper`'s [Switch](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/switch.html) for this purpose.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { useTheme, Appbar, TouchableRipple, Switch } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport { PreferencesContext } from './PreferencesContext';\n\nconst Header = ({ scene }) => {\n  const theme = useTheme();\n  const { toggleTheme, isThemeDark } = React.useContext(PreferencesContext);\n\n  return (\n    <Appbar.Header\n      theme={{\n        colors: {\n          primary: theme?.colors.surface,\n        },\n      }}\n    >\n      <Appbar.Content title={scene.route?.name} />\n        <Switch\n          color={'red'}\n          value={isThemeDark}\n          onValueChange={toggleTheme}\n        />\n    </Appbar.Header>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nAnd now you can switch between light and dark theme!\n\n![paperGuide1](screenshots/themingWithReactNavigationDarkLightSwitch.gif)\n\nThanks to the linking of themes that we did earlier, switching themes can be controlled with only one piece of state.\n\nReact Native Paper components will automatically use provided theme thanks to the `PaperProvider` that is wrapped around the entry point of our application, but we can also access theme values manually with `useTheme` hook,\nexposed by the library. You can see how it's done in the `Header` component code above.\n\nIf light/dark themes are not enough for your use case, you can learn more about creating Material Design themes [here](https://material.io/design/material-theming/implementing-your-theme.html#color).\nOn `main` branch of the example app, you will find implemented [Menu](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/menu.html) component, which allows to choose a few custom themes. Inspecting code in `utils` and `Header` may give you some idea how to use your own themes with `Paper`, in addition to dedicated [docs](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/menu.html).\n\nRead more about integrating `Paper` with `React Navigation` in a brilliant [article](https://reactnavigation.org/blog/2020/01/29/using-react-navigation-5-with-react-native-paper/) by [@trensik](https://twitter.com/trensik)\n",type:"md",dependencies:[]},{filepath:"pages/9.react-navigation.md",title:"Integrate AppBar with react-navigation",description:"",link:"integrate-app-bar-with-react-navigation",data:'# Integrate AppBar with react-navigation\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n - `react-native-paper`\n - `react-navigation`\n \nWe assume that you have already installed the mentioned libraries above, otherwise please check out the guides below.\n \n [React Native Paper - Getting Started](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/getting-started.html)\n \n [React Navigation - Getting Started](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/)\n\n## Stack Navigator\n\nWe will start with `react-navigation` by creating a basic navigation stack. Stack navigator gives us a possibility of transition between screens in our app and manage navigation\'s history. In a simple scenario where there is only one stack navigator present in the app, it resembles a navigation state in a browser.\nScreens are pushed and popped from the stack while the user navigates to a new screen or go back to the previous one.\n\nLet\'s create two screens. A main screen named `Home` and details screen named `Details`.\n\n```js\nimport \'react-native-gesture-handler\';\nimport React from \'react\';\nimport { NavigationContainer } from \'@react-navigation/native\';\nimport { createStackNavigator } from \'@react-navigation/stack\';\n\nconst Stack = createStackNavigator();\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <NavigationContainer>\n      <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Home">\n        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />\n        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />\n      </Stack.Navigator>\n    </NavigationContainer>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nAt the moment our navigation stack contains two screens and will render `HomeScreen` or `DetailsScreen` components according to the current navigation state. We have not implemented those components yet, so let\'s do this now:\n\n```js\nimport React from \'react\';\nimport {View, Text, Button, StyleSheet} from \'react-native\';\n\nfunction HomeScreen() {\n  return (\n    <View style={style.container}>\n      <Text>Home Screen</Text>\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction DetailsScreen() {\n  return (\n    <View style={style.container}>\n      <Text>Details Screen</Text>\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n\nconst style = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    alignItems: \'center\',\n    justifyContent: \'center\',\n  },\n});\n```\n\nOnce we have finished implementing the components, we can run the app and check how Stack looks like.\n\n![navigationAppBar1](screenshots/react-navigation-appBar1.png)\n\nTo navigate from `HomeScreen` to `DetailsScreen` we can use the navigation object provided by `Stack.Screen` component. Every component rendered by `Stack.Screen` has an access to the navigation object via props. Let\'s modify our `HomeScreen` component:\n\n```js\nfunction HomeScreen({ navigation }) {\n  return (\n    <View style={style.container}>\n      <Text>Home Screen</Text>\n      <Button\n        title="Go to details"\n        onPress={() => navigation.navigate(\'Details\')}\n      />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nOur result:\n\n![navigationAppBar2](screenshots/react-navigation-appBar2.gif)\n\nAs you can see, we can already navigate between two screens. In the next steps, we will show you how to use Paper\'s `AppBar` instead of the default header.\n\n### Adding AppBar\n\nWe can customize Stack\'s header by passing custom component:\n\n```js\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <NavigationContainer>\n      <Stack.Navigator\n        initialRouteName="Home"\n        screenOptions={{\n          header: CustomNavigationBar,\n        }}>\n        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />\n        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />\n      </Stack.Navigator>\n    </NavigationContainer>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNow we will implement `CustomNavigationBar` using `AppBar` component:\n\n```js\nimport { Appbar } from \'react-native-paper\';\n\nfunction CustomNavigationBar() {\n  return (\n    <Appbar.Header>\n      <Appbar.Content title="My awesome app" />\n    </Appbar.Header>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nCurrent implementation of the `CustomNavigationBar` is simple - we just render a title inside of it. You may notice there is no way to go back to the previous screen, because the back button is not visible in the header. Let\'s add it now and let\'s make sure it\'s visible on all Stack\'s screens except `Home` screen.\n\nFirstly, pass navigation props to `CustomNavigationBar`:\n\n```js\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <NavigationContainer>\n      <Stack.Navigator\n        initialRouteName="Home"\n        screenOptions={{\n          header: (props) => <CustomNavigationBar {...props} />,\n        }}>\n        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />\n        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />\n      </Stack.Navigator>\n    </NavigationContainer>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nSecondly, we check if the navigation bar receives a `back` prop. If it has, it means there is another screen on the stack beneath the current screen and we should render the back arrow button in such a case. (The `back` prop is sent in React Navigation 6.x; in 5.x a prop named `previous` is sent and can be checked for instead.)\n\n```js\nfunction CustomNavigationBar({ navigation, back }) {\n  return (\n    <Appbar.Header>\n      {back ? <Appbar.BackAction onPress={navigation.goBack} /> : null}\n      <Appbar.Content title="My awesome app" />\n    </Appbar.Header>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n![navigationAppBar3](screenshots/react-navigation-appBar3.gif)\n\n\nAnother interesting pattern that can be implemented with `react-native-paper` and `react-navigation` is a "hamburger menu". Thanks to the `Menu` component we can add a nice looking pop-up to our `Appbar`. To implement this feature we need to make a couple of changes in `CustomNavigationBar`:\n- Render a `Menu` component\n- Pass `Appbar.Action` to the anchor prop\n- Add a state to control `Menu` visibility\n\nWe also want the menu to appear only on `HomeScreen`, which means we will render it conditionally based on the `back` prop.\n\n```js\nfunction CustomNavigationBar({ navigation, back }) {\n  const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState(false);\n  const openMenu = () => setVisible(true);\n  const closeMenu = () => setVisible(false);\n\n  return (\n    <Appbar.Header>\n      {back ? <Appbar.BackAction onPress={navigation.goBack} /> : null}\n      <Appbar.Content title="My awesome app" />\n      {!back ? (\n        <Menu\n          visible={visible}\n          onDismiss={closeMenu}\n          anchor={\n            <Appbar.Action icon="menu" color="white" onPress={openMenu} />\n          }>\n          <Menu.Item onPress={() => {console.log(\'Option 1 was pressed\')}} title="Option 1" />\n          <Menu.Item onPress={() => {console.log(\'Option 2 was pressed\')}} title="Option 2" />\n          <Menu.Item onPress={() => {console.log(\'Option 3 was pressed\')}} title="Option 3" disabled />\n        </Menu>\n      ) : null}\n    </Appbar.Header>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nFinal result:\n\n![navigationAppBar4](screenshots/react-navigation-appBar4.gif)\n\nThat\'s all we need! We have app bar that contains everything we need to navigate through screens and access an additional menu on the main screen. As you can see, with Material design `Appbar` provided by `react-native-paper` used together with `react-navigation` we can easily create an app that looks and works great.\n',type:"md",dependencies:[]},{type:"separator"},{filepath:"../src/components/ActivityIndicator.tsx",title:"ActivityIndicator",description:'Activity indicator is used to present progress of some activity in the app.\nIt can be used as a drop-in for the ActivityIndicator shipped with React Native.\n\n<div class="screenshots">\n  <img src="screenshots/activity-indicator.gif" style="width: 100px;" />\n</div>\n\n## Usage\n```js\nimport * as React from \'react\';\nimport { ActivityIndicator, MD2Colors } from \'react-native-paper\';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => (\n  <ActivityIndicator animating={true} color={MD2Colors.red800} />\n);\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```',link:"activity-indicator",data:{description:'Activity indicator is used to present progress of some activity in the app.\nIt can be used as a drop-in for the ActivityIndicator shipped with React Native.\n\n<div class="screenshots">\n  <img src="screenshots/activity-indicator.gif" style="width: 100px;" />\n</div>\n\n## Usage\n```js\nimport * as React from \'react\';\nimport { ActivityIndicator, MD2Colors } from \'react-native-paper\';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => (\n  <ActivityIndicator animating={true} color={MD2Colors.red800} />\n);\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```',displayName:"ActivityIndicator",methods:[],statics:[],props:{animating:{required:!1,tsType:{name:"boolean"},description:"Whether to show the indicator or hide it.",defaultValue:{value:"true",computed:!1}},color:{required:!1,tsType:{name:"string"},description:"The color of the spinner."},size:{required:!1,tsType:{name:"union",raw:"'small' | 'large' | number",elements:[{name:"literal",value:"'small'"},{name:"literal",value:"'large'"},{name:"number"}]},description:"Size of the indicator.",defaultValue:{value:"'small'",computed:!1}},hidesWhenStopped:{required:!1,tsType:{name:"boolean"},description:"Whether the indicator should hide when not animating.",defaultValue:{value:"true",computed:!1}},style:{required:!1,tsType:{name:"StyleProp",elements:[{name:"ViewStyle"}],raw:"StyleProp<ViewStyle>"},description:""},theme:{required:!0,tsType:{name:"InternalTheme"},description:"@optional"}}},type:"component",dependencies:["/home/circleci/react-native-paper/src/components/ActivityIndicator.tsx"]},{filepath:"../src/components/FAB/AnimatedFAB.tsx",title:"AnimatedFAB",description:"An animated, extending horizontally floating action button represents the primary action in an application.\n\n<div class=\"screenshots\">\n  <img class=\"small\" src=\"screenshots/animated-fab.gif\" />\n</div>\n\n## Usage\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport {\n  StyleProp,\n  ViewStyle,\n  Animated,\n  StyleSheet,\n  Platform,\n  ScrollView,\n  Text,\n  SafeAreaView,\n  I18nManager,\n} from 'react-native';\nimport { AnimatedFAB } from 'react-native-paper';\n\nconst MyComponent = ({\n  animatedValue,\n  visible,\n  extended,\n  label,\n  animateFrom,\n  style,\n  iconMode,\n}) => {\n  const [isExtended, setIsExtended] = React.useState(true);\n\n  const isIOS = Platform.OS === 'ios';\n\n  const onScroll = ({ nativeEvent }) => {\n    const currentScrollPosition =\n      Math.floor(nativeEvent?.contentOffset?.y) ??
