Started",description:"",link:"getting-started",data:"# Getting Started\n\n## Installation\n\nOpen a Terminal in your project's folder and run,\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-native-paper\n```\n\nIf you're on a vanilla React Native project, you also need to install and link [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons).\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-native-vector-icons\nreact-native link react-native-vector-icons\n```\n\nIf you don't want to install vector icons, you can use [babel-plugin-optional-require](https://github.com/satya164/babel-plugin-optional-require) to opt-out.\n\nIf you use Expo, you don't need to install vector icons. But if you have a `babel.config.js` or `.babelrc` file, make sure that it includes `babel-preset-expo`.\n\nTo get smaller bundle size by excluding modules you don't use, you can use our optional babel plugin. The plugin automatically rewrites the import statements so that only the modules you use are imported instead of the whole library. Add `react-native-paper/babel` to the `plugins` section in your `babel.config.js` for production environment. It should look like this:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],\n  env: {\n    production: {\n      plugins: ['react-native-paper/babel'],\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIf you created your project using Expo, it'll look something like this:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function(api) {\n  api.cache(true);\n  return {\n    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],\n    env: {\n      production: {\n        plugins: ['react-native-paper/babel'],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n};\n```\n\nThe plugin only works if you are importing the library using ES2015 import statements and not with `require`.\n\n**Note:** The above examples are for the latest `react-native` using Babel 7. If you have `react-native <= 0.55`, you'll have a `.babelrc` file instead of a `babel.config.js` file and the content of the file will be different.\n\nIf you're using Flow for typechecking your code, you need to add the following under the `[options]` section in your `.flowconfig`:\n\n```ini\nmodule.file_ext=.js\nmodule.file_ext=.native.js\nmodule.file_ext=.android.js\nmodule.file_ext=.ios.js\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nWrap your root component in `Provider` from `react-native-paper`. If you have a vanilla React Native project, it's a good idea to add it in the component which is passed to `AppRegistry.registerComponent`. This will usually be in the `index.js` file. If you have an Expo project, you can do this inside the exported component in the `App.js` file.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';\nimport { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('main', () => Main);\n```\n\nThe `PaperProvider` component provides the theme to all the components in the framework. It also acts as a portal to components which need to be rendered at the top level.\n\nIf you have another provider (such as `Redux`), wrap it outside `PaperProvider` so that the context is available to components rendered inside a `Modal` from the library:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport { Provider as StoreProvider } from 'react-redux';\nimport App from './src/App';\nimport store from './store';\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <StoreProvider store={store}>\n      <PaperProvider>\n        <App />\n      </PaperProvider>\n    </StoreProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can provide a custom theme to customize the colors, fonts etc. with the `Provider` component. Check the [default theme](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/master/src/styles/DefaultTheme.tsx) to see what customization options are supported.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { DefaultTheme, Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nconst theme = {\n  ...DefaultTheme,\n  colors: {\n    ...DefaultTheme.colors,\n    primary: 'tomato',\n    accent: 'yellow',\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider theme={theme}>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n",type:"md",dependencies:[]},{filepath:"pages/2.theming.md",title:"Theming",description:"",link:"theming",data:"# Theming\n\n## Applying a theme to the whole app\n\nTo support custom themes, paper exports a `Provider` component. You need to wrap your root component with the provider to be able to support themes.\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIf no prop is specified, this will apply the [default theme](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/master/src/styles/DefaultTheme.tsx) to the components. You can also provide a `theme` prop with a theme object with same properties as the default theme:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { DefaultTheme, Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nconst theme = {\n  ...DefaultTheme,\n  roundness: 2,\n  colors: {\n    ...DefaultTheme.colors,\n    primary: '#3498db',\n    accent: '#f1c40f',\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider theme={theme}>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nYou can change the theme prop dynamically and all the components will automatically update to reflect the new theme.\n\nA theme usually contains the following properties:\n\n- `dark` (`boolean`): whether this is a dark theme or light theme.\n- `mode` (`'adaptive' | 'exact'`): color mode for dark theme (See [Dark Theme](#dark-theme)).\n- `roundness` (`number`): roundness of common elements, such as buttons.\n- `colors` (`object`): various colors used throughout different elements.\n  - `primary` - primary color for your app, usually your brand color.\n  - `accent` - secondary color for your app which complements the primary color.\n  - `background` - background color for pages, such as lists.\n  - `surface` - background color for elements containing content, such as cards.\n  - `text` - text color for content.\n  - `disabled` - color for disabled elements.\n  - `placeholder` - color for placeholder text, such as input placeholder.\n  - `backdrop` - color for backdrops of various components such as modals.\n- `fonts` (`object`): various fonts used throughout different elements.\n  - `regular`\n  - `medium`\n  - `light`\n  - `thin`\n\nWhen creating a custom theme, you will need to provide all of these properties.\n\n## Applying a theme to a paper component\n\nIf you want to change the theme for a certain component from the library, you can directly pass the `theme` prop to the component. The theme passed as the prop is merged with the theme from the `Provider`.\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Button } from 'react-native-paper';\n\nexport default function ButtonExample() {\n  return (\n    <Button raised theme={{ roundness: 3 }}>\n      Press me\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Using the theme in your own components\n\nTo access the theme in your own components, you can use the `withTheme` HOC exported from the library. If you wrap your component with the HOC, you'll receive the theme as a prop.\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { withTheme } from 'react-native-paper';\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  const { colors } = props.theme;\n  return <Text style={{ color: colors.primary }}>Yo!</Text>;\n}\n\nexport default withTheme(MyComponent);\n```\n\nComponents wrapped with `withTheme` support the theme from the `Provider` as well as from the `theme` prop.\n\n## Customizing all instances of a component\n\nSometimes you want to style a component in a different way everywhere and don't want to change the properties in the theme so that other components are not affected. For example, say you want to change the font for all your buttons, but don't want to change `theme.fonts.medium` because it affects other components.\n\nWe don't have an API to do this, because you can already do it with components:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Button } from 'react-native-paper';\n\nexport default function FancyButton(props) {\n  return <Button theme={{ fonts: { medium: 'Open Sans' } }} {...props} />;\n}\n```\n\nNow you can use your `FancyButton` component everywhere instead of using `Button` from Paper.\n\n## Dark Theme\n\nSince 3.0 We adapt Dark theme to follow [Material design guidelines](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html). </br>\nIn opposition to light theme, dark theme by default uses `surface` colour instead of `primary` on large components like `AppBar` or `BottomNavigation`.</br>\nThe Dark theme adds a white overlay with opacity depending on elevation of surfaces. It uses it for the better accentuation of surface elevation. Using only shadow is highly imperceptible on dark surfaces.\n\nWe are aware that users often use Dark theme in their own ways and they maybe don't want to use default dark theme features from guidelines</br>\nThat's why if you are using the dark mode you can switch between two types of dark theme `mode`:\n\n`exact` where everything is like it was before. Appbar and BottomNavigation will still use primary colour by default</br>\n`adaptive` where we follow [Material design guidelines](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html), the surface will use white overlay with opacity to show elevation, `Appbar` and `BottomNavigation` will use surface colour as a background.\n\n## Gotchas\n\nThe `Provider` exposes the theme to the components via [React's context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), which means that the component must be in the same tree as the `Provider`. Some React Native components will render a different tree such as a `Modal`, in which case the components inside the `Modal` won't be able to access the theme. The work around is to get the theme using the `withTheme` HOC and pass it down to the components as props, or expose it again with the exported `ThemeProvider` component.\n\nThe `Modal` component from the library already handles this edge case, so you won't need to do anything.\n",type:"md",dependencies:[]},function(){var e=n("./node_modules/react/index.js"),t=n("./node_modules/component-docs/dist/templates/Content.js").default,o={exports:{}},i={react:n("./node_modules/react/index.js"),"@mdx-js/tag":n("./node_modules/@mdx-js/tag/dist/index.js"),"./src/components/IconsList.js":n("./pages/src/components/IconsList.js")};!function(e,t,n,o,i){"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),t.default=t.meta=void 0;var a,s=function(e){if(e&&e.__esModule)return e;var t=u();if(t&&t.has(e))return t.get(e);var n={};if(null!=e){var r=Object.defineProperty&&Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;for(var o in e)if(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,o)){var i=r?Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,o):null;i&&(i.get||i.set)?Object.defineProperty(n,o,i):n[o]=e[o]}}n.default=e,t&&t.set(e,n);return n}(n("react")),l=n("@mdx-js/tag"),c=(a=n("./src/components/IconsList.js"))&&a.__esModule?a:{default:a};function u(){if("function"!=typeof WeakMap)return null;var e=new WeakMap;return u=function(){return e},e}function p(e){return(p="function"==typeof Symbol&&"symbol"===r(Symbol.iterator)?function(e){return r(e)}:function(e){return e&&"function"==typeof Symbol&&e.constructor===Symbol&&e!==Symbol.prototype?"symbol":r(e)})(e)}function d(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,r,o=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,r,o={},i=Object.keys(e);for(r=0;r<i.length;r++)n=i[r],t.indexOf(n)>=0||(o[n]=e[n]);return o}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(r=0;r<i.length;r++)n=i[r],t.indexOf(n)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,n)&&(o[n]=e[n])}return o}function h(e,t){for(var n=0;n<t.length;n++){var r=t[n];r.enumerable=r.enumerable||!1,r.configurable=!0,"value"in r&&(r.writable=!0),Object.defineProperty(e,r.key,r)}}function m(e,t){return!t||"object"!==p(t)&&"function"!=typeof t?function(e){if(void 0===e)throw new ReferenceError("this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called");return e}(e):t}function f(e){return(f=Object.setPrototypeOf?Object.getPrototypeOf:function(e){return e.__proto__||Object.getPrototypeOf(e)})(e)}function g(e,t){return(g=Object.setPrototypeOf||function(e,t){return e.__proto__=t,e})(e,t)}var y={title:"Icons"};t.meta=y;var b=function(e){function t(e){var n;return function(e,t){if(!(e instanceof t))throw new TypeError("Cannot call a class as a function")}(this,t),(n=m(this,f(t).call(this,e))).layout=null,n}var n,r,o;return function(e,t){if("function"!=typeof t&&null!==t)throw new TypeError("Super expression must either be null or a function");e.prototype=Object.create(t&&t.prototype,{constructor:{value:e,writable:!0,configurable:!0}}),t&&g(e,t)}(t,e),n=t,(r=[{key:"render",value:function(){var e=this.props,t=e.components;return d(e,["components"]),s.createElement(l.MDXTag,{name:"wrapper",components:t},s.createElement(l.MDXTag,{name:"h1",components:t},"Icons"),s.createElement(l.MDXTag,{name:"h2",components:t},"Configuring icons"),s.createElement(l.MDXTag,{name:"p",components:t},"Many of the components require the ",s.createElement(l.MDXTag,{name:"a",components:t,parentName:"p",props:{href:"https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons"}},"react-native-vector-icons")," library to render correctly.

Define path to asssets directory with fonts in project:\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```js\n    // React Native < 0.60 package.json\n    ...\n      \"rnpm\": {\n        \"assets\": [\n          \"fonts\"\n        ]\n      },\n    ...\n\n    // React Native >= 0.60 react-native.config.js\n    module.exports = {\n    ...\n    \"assets\": [\n      \"fonts\"\n    ],\n    ...\n  ```\n\n  Note: fonts is a folder with .ttf files\n\n  2. Place your fonts files in your assets folder\n  3. Link fonts files using '`react-native link`' command\n  4. Restart your project to refresh changes\n  5. You are able to use fontFamily based on fonts files\n\n## Configuring fonts in ThemeProvider\n\nTo create a custom font you need to prepare `fontConfig` where fonts are divided by platforms. \nAfter you have to pass the `fontConfig` into `configureFonts` method in a custom theme. \n\nNote: To override font on all platforms use `deafult` key.\n\nCheck the [default theme](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/master/src/styles/DefaultTheme.tsx) to see what customization options are supported.\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { configureFonts, DefaultTheme, Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nconst fontConfig = {\n  default: {\n    regular: {\n      fontFamily: 'sans-serif',\n      fontWeight: 'normal',\n    },\n    medium: {\n      fontFamily: 'sans-serif-medium',\n      fontWeight: 'normal',\n    },\n    light: {\n      fontFamily: 'sans-serif-light',\n      fontWeight: 'normal',\n    },\n    thin: {\n      fontFamily: 'sans-serif-thin',\n      fontWeight: 'normal',\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nconst theme = {\n  ...DefaultTheme,\n  fonts: configureFonts(fontConfig),\n};\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider theme={theme}>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n",type:"md",dependencies:[]},{filepath:"pages/5.react-native-web.md",title:"Using on the Web",description:"",link:"using-on-the-web",data:'# Using on the Web\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\nMake sure that you have followed the getting started guide and have `react-native-paper` installed and configured before following this guide.\n\nWe\'re going to use [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to use React Native Paper on the web, so let\'s install them as well.\n\nTo install `react-native-web`, run:\n\n```sh\nyarn add react-native-web react-dom react-art\n```\n\n### Using CRA ([Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))\n\nInstall [`react-app-rewired`](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) to override `webpack` configuration:\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev react-app-rewired\n```\n\n[Configure `babel-loader`](#2-configure-babel-loader) using a new file called `config-overrides.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function override(config, env) {\n  config.module.rules.push({\n    test: /\\.js$/,\n    exclude: /node_modules[/\\\\](?!react-native-paper|react-native-vector-icons|react-native-safe-area-view)/,\n    use: {\n      loader: "babel-loader",\n      options: {\n        // Disable reading babel configuration\n        babelrc: false,\n        configFile: false,\n\n        // The configration for compilation\n        presets: [\n          ["@babel/preset-env", { useBuiltIns: "usage" }],\n          "@babel/preset-react",\n          "@babel/preset-flow"\n        ],\n        plugins: [\n          "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties",\n          "@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  return config;\n};\n```\n\nChange your script in `package.json`:\n\n```diff\n/* package.json */\n\n  "scripts": {\n-   "start": "react-scripts start",\n+   "start": "react-app-rewired start",\n-   "build": "react-scripts build",\n+   "build": "react-app-rewired build",\n-   "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",\n+   "test": "react-app-rewired test --env=jsdom"\n}\n```\n\n### Custom webpack setup\n\nTo install `webpack`, run:\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server\n```\n\nIf you don\'t have a webpack config in your project, copy the following to `webpack.config.js` get started:\n\n```js\nconst path = require(\'path\');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: \'development\',\n\n  // Path to the entry file, change it according to the path you have\n  entry: path.join(__dirname, \'App.js\'),\n\n  // Path for the output files\n  output: {\n    path: path.join(__dirname, \'dist\'),\n    filename: \'app.bundle.js\',\n  },\n\n  // Enable source map support\n  devtool: \'source-map\',\n\n  // Loaders and resolver config\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n\n    ],\n  },\n  resolve: {\n\n  },\n\n  // Development server config\n  devServer: {\n    contentBase: [path.join(__dirname, \'public\')],\n    historyApiFallback: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\nAlso create a folder named `public` and add the following file named `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<head>\n  <meta charSet="utf-8" />\n  <meta httpEquiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />\n\n  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1" />\n\n  <title>App</title>\n\n  <style>\n    html, body, #root {\n      height: 100%;\n    }\n\n    #root {\n      display: flex;\n      flex-direction: column;\n    }\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div id="root"></div>\n  <script src="app.bundle.js"><\/script>\n</body>\n```\n\nNow we\'re ready to start configuring the project.\n\n## Configure webpack\n\n### 1. Alias `react-native` to `react-native-web`\n\nFirst, we have to tell webpack to use `react-native-web` instead of `react-native`. Add the following alias in your webpack config under `resolve`:\n\n```js\nalias: {\n  \'react-native$\': require.resolve(\'react-native-web\'),\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Configure `babel-loader`\n\nNext, we want to tell `babel-loader` to compile `react-native-paper` and `react-native-vector-icons`. We would also want to disable reading the babel configuration files to prevent any conflicts.\n\nFirst install the required dependencies:\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-flow @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread\n```\n\nNow, add the following in the `module.rules` array in your webpack config:\n\n```js\n{\n  test: /\\.js$/,\n  exclude: /node_modules[/\\\\](?!react-native-paper|react-native-vector-icons|react-native-safe-area-view)/,\n  use: {\n    loader: \'babel-loader\',\n    options: {\n      // Disable reading babel configuration\n      babelrc: false,\n      configFile: false,\n\n      // The configration for compilation\n      presets: [\n        [\'@babel/preset-env\', { useBuiltIns: \'usage\' }],\n        \'@babel/preset-react\',\n        \'@babel/preset-flow\',\n      ],\n      plugins: [\n        \'@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties\',\n        \'@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread\'\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n},\n```\n\n### 3. Configure `file-loader`\n\nTo be able to import images and other assets using `require`, we need to configure `file-loader`. Let\'s install it:\n\n```sh\nyarn add --dev file-loader\n```\n\nTo configure it, add the following in the `module.rules` array in your webpack config:\n\n```js\n{\n  test: /\\.(jpg|png|woff|woff2|eot|ttf|svg)$/,\n  loader: \'file-loader\',\n}\n```\n\n## Load the Material Community Icons\n\nIf you followed the getting started guide, you should have the following code in your root component:\n\n```js\n<PaperProvider>\n  <App />\n</PaperProvider>\n```\n\nNow we need tweak this section to load the Material Community Icons from the [`react-native-vector-icons`](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) library:\n\n```js\n<PaperProvider>\n  <React.Fragment>\n    {Platform.OS === \'web\' ? (\n      <style type="text/css">{`\n        @font-face {\n          font-family: \'MaterialCommunityIcons\';\n          src: url(${require(\'react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/MaterialCommunityIcons.ttf\')}) format(\'truetype\');\n        }\n      `}</style>\n    ) : null}\n    <App />\n  </React.Fragment>\n</PaperProvider>\n```\n\nRemember to import `Platform` from `react-native` at the top:\n\n```js\nimport { Platform } from \'react-native\';\n```\n\nYou can also load these fonts using [`css-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) if you prefer.\n\n## Load the Roboto fonts (optional)\n\nThe default theme in React Native Paper uses the Roboto font. You can add them to your project following [the instructions on its Google Fonts page](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?selection.family=Roboto:100,300,400,500).\n\n## We\'re done!\n\nYou can run `webpack-dev-server` to run the webpack server and open your project in the browser. You can add the following script in your `package.json` under the `"scripts"` section to make it easier:\n\n```json\n"web": "webpack-dev-server --open"\n```\n\nNow you can run `yarn web` to run the project on web.\n',type:"md",dependencies:[]},{filepath:"pages/6.recommended-libraries.md",title:"Recommended Libraries",description:"",link:"recommended-libraries",data:"# Recommended Libraries\n\nOur mission is to provide a full suite of well-integrated components built with Material Design in mind.

Please read [the full text](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\n\n## Our Development Process\n\nThe core team works directly on GitHub and all work is public.\n\n### Development workflow\n\n> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this *free* series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).\n\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master` (a guide on [how to fork a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)).\n2. Run `yarn bootstrap` to setup the development environment.\n3. Do the changes you want and test them out in the example app before sending a pull request.\n\n### Commit message convention\n\nWe follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:\n\n* `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix Button color on DarkTheme.\n* `feat`: new features, e.g. add Snackbar component.\n* `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. new folder structure for components.\n* `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for Button.\n* `test`: adding or updating tests, eg unit, snapshot testing.\n* `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change circleci config.\n* `BREAKING CHANGE`: for changes that break existing usage, e.g. change API of a component.\n\nOur pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.\n\n### Linting and tests\n\nWe use `flow` for type checking, `eslint` with `prettier` for linting and formatting the code, and `jest` for testing. Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter and tests pass when commiting. You can also run the following commands manually:\n\n* `yarn flow`: run flow on all files.\n* `yarn typescript`: run tests for typescript definitions.\n* `yarn lint`: lint files with eslint and prettier.\n* `yarn test`: run unit tests with jest.\n\n### Sending a pull request\n\nWhen you're sending a pull request:\n\n* Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.\n* Verify that `flow`, `eslint` and all tests are passing.\n* Preview the documentation to make sure it looks good.\n* Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.\n\nWhen you're working on a component:\n\n* Follow the guidelines described in the [official material design docs](https://material.io/guidelines/).\n* Write a brief description of every prop when defining `type Props` to aid with documentation.\n* Provide an example usage for the component (check other components to get a idea).\n* Update the type definitions for Flow and Typescript if you changed an API or added a component.\n\n### Running the example\n\nThe example app uses [Expo](https://expo.io/) for the React Native example. You will need to install the Expo app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) to start developing.\n\nAfter you're done, you can run `yarn example start` in the project root (or `expo start` in the `example/` folder) and scan the QR code to launch it on your device.\n\nTo run the example on web, run `yarn example web` in the project root.\n\n### Working on documentation\n\nThe documentation is automatically generated from the [flowtype](https://flowtype.org) annotations in the components. You can add comments above the type annotations to add descriptions. To preview the generated documentation, run `yarn docs start` in the project root.\n\n### Publishing a release\n\nWe use [release-it](https://github.com/webpro/release-it) to automate our release. If you have publish access to the NPM package, run the following from the master branch to publish a new release:\n\n```sh\nyarn release\n```\n\nNOTE: You must have a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable available. You can create a GitHub access token with the \"repo\" access [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nYou can report issues on our [bug tracker](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/issues).
