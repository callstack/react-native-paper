title: Introducing v5 with Material You
---

React Native Paper v5 is all about adopting the new Material Design 3 <i>aka</i> Material You. It was released in October 2021 after intense work and effort to make Material You follow a more expressive approach to design.

Paper now supports both Material Design 2 and 3 through the configuration described in [Versioning](#versioning) and is compatible with a handful of API changes. 

# Migration guide to Material You (5.0 RC)

Version 5.0 brings support for the next Material Design iteration branded as Material You <i>(in fact being Material Design v3 or in short MD3)</i> into the `react-native-paper` library. All the components were refined according to the official [design kit on figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460) and adjusted in terms of visuals by changes in colors, typography and animations. 

Below you can find the most important information about the components whose API may have changed  API has been changed due to supporting new props, renaming existing ones or some deprecations. Hopefully, based on the presented required changes, migration to the latest version should be smooth. Enjoy!

### Installation

Currently v5 is a release candidate, which means it won't be installed by default from the `npm`. In order to do that, there is a need to explicitly pass package version during installation:

```sh
yarn add react-native-paper@5.0.0-rc.10
```
or
```sh
npm install react-native-paper@5.0.0-rc.10
```
## Theming

### Versioning

Introducing Material You <i>(MD3)</i> into `react-native-paper` doesn't mean dropping previous Material Design <i>(MD2)</i>! On the contrary, both of them will be supported, however, not simultaneously. To specify which design system components should follow in the app, there is a newly created property in the theme called `version` which can accept only one of two values:

* <b>3</b> – <b>(default)</b> new Material You <i>(MD3)</i>,
* <b>2</b> - previous Material Design <i>(MD2)</i>.

```js
theme: {
  /* ... */
  version: 3 | 2
}
```

Read more about using Material Design 2 in our [Material Design 2 theming guide](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/theming.html#material-design-2)

### Colors

New theme introduces a new color palette along with new namings reflecting design color tokens, but written in camel case. Palette contains a set of five key colors, where primary, secondary and tertiary are classified into <i>accent colors</i>. The second group of colors is <i>neutral and neutral variant colors</i> used for defining surface or background roles as well as specifying high and medium emphasis text and icons. Additionally, the color system includes a semantic color role for error.

Each accent and error colors has a group of related tones. The tones are mapped to roles that create contrast and visual interest when applied to elements in the UI.

📍<i>Note: Dynamic colors are not supported yet.</i>

<img class="medium" src="migration/color-palette.png" />

Colors theme structure should follow the default palette and contain the following properties:

```js
theme: {
  /* ... */
  colors: {
    primary,
    primaryContainer,
    secondary,
    secondaryContainer,
    tertiary,
    tertiaryContainer,
    surface,
    surfaceVariant,
    surfaceDisabled,
    background,
    error,
    errorContainer,
    onPrimary,
    onPrimaryContainer,
    onSecondary,
    onSecondaryContainer,
    onTertiary,
    onTertiaryContainer,
    onSurface,
    onSurfaceVariant,
    onSurfaceDisabled,
    onError,
    onErrorContainer,
    onBackground,
    outline,
    shadow,
    inverseOnSurface,
    inverseSurface,
    inversePrimary,
    backdrop,
    elevation: {
      level0,
      level1,
      level2,
      level3,
      level4,
      level5
    }
  }
}
```

## Typography

A new way of approaching typography introduces one component `<Text>` which accepts prop `variant`. Variant defines appropriate text styles for type role and its size. The updated type scale organizes styles into five roles that are named to describe their purposes: <b>Display</b>, <b>Headline</b>, <b>Title</b>, <b>Label</b> and <b>Body</b> along with three display styles <i>large</i>, <i>medium</i>, and <i>small</i>. In total, there are fifteen variants that are MD3 compliant and are reflecting design typography tokens written in camel case. 

```js
<Text variant="displayLarge">Display Large</Text>
<Text variant="displayMedium">Display Medium</Text>
<Text variant="displaySmall">Display small</Text>

<Text variant="headlineLarge">Headline Large</Text>
<Text variant="headlineMedium">Headline Medium</Text>
<Text variant="headlineSmall">Headline Small</Text>

<Text variant="titleLarge">Title Large</Text>
<Text variant="titleMedium">Title Medium</Text>
<Text variant="titleSmall">Title Small</Text>

<Text variant="bodyLarge">Body Large</Text>
<Text variant="bodyMedium">Body Medium</Text>
<Text variant="bodySmall">Body Small</Text>

<Text variant="labelLarge">Label Large</Text>
<Text variant="labelMedium">Label Medium</Text>
<Text variant="labelSmall">Label Small</Text>
 ```

Take a look at the suggested replacement diff:

 ```diff
- <Headline>Headline</Headline>
+ <Text variant="headlineSmall">Headline</Text>

- <Title>Title</Title>
+ <Text variant="titleLarge">Title</Text>

- <Subheading>Subheading</Subheading>
+ <Text variant="titleMedium">Subheading</Text>

- <Paragraph>Paragraph</Paragraph>
+ <Text variant="bodyMedium">Paragraph</Text>

- <Caption>Caption</Caption>
+ <Text variant="bodySmall">Caption</Text>
 ```

### Configure fonts

The existing utility called `configureFonts` was adjusted to help users configure their theme fonts in both version, that's why that function, as of today, is going to accept the object with the follwing properties as an argument:

```ts
configureFonts(params)
```

<b>Parameters:</b>

| NAME        | TYPE        | REQUIRED    |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| params      | object      | No          |

Valid `params` keys are:

  * `config` ([MD2FontsConfig](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/main/src/styles/fonts.tsx#L63) | [MD3FontsConfig](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/main/src/styles/fonts.tsx#L67)) - fonts config object appropriate to the MD version
  * `isV3` (boolean) - whether adjusting theme fonts for v3. Default it <b>true</b>.

To use your current font config from <b>v2</b> and migrate to <b>v3</b> there are two requirements:
* the font config previously passed directly into function has to be passed into the params object property called `config`
* the params object property `isV3` has to be set to `false`

```diff
- configureFonts(fontConfig)
+ configureFonts({config: fontConfig, isV3: false})
```

📍<i>Note: If you want to check how to use `configureFonts` on MD3, check the [Fonts](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/fonts.html) guide.</i>

# Components

## Appbar <i>(Top app bar)</i>

`Appbar` and `Appbar.Header` in the latest version can be used in four various modes due to new prop `mode`:

* `small` - Appbar with default height <i>(56) (default)</i>,
* `medium` - Appbar with medium height <i>(112)</i>,
* `large` - Appbar with large height <i>(152)</i>,
* `center-aligned` - Appbar with default height <i>(56)</i> and center-aligned title.

```js
<Appbar mode="center-aligned">
  /* ... */
</Appbar>
```

To make it easier for users to build the `BottomBar`, formed on the `Appbar` components, we have added a property `safeAreaInsets`:

```js
<Appbar safeAreaInsets={{ bottom: 47 }}>
  /* ... */
</Appbar>
```
 
It's worth noting that by default the theme version 3 `Appbar` and `Appbar.Header` don't have a shadow. However, it can be added by passing prop `elevated` into the component:

```js
<Appbar elevated>
  /* ... */
</Appbar>
```

### Appbar.Action

`Appbar.Action` received new prop `isLeading`, which defines whether it's the <b>leading</b> button and should be placed at the beginning of the `Appbar`.

```js
<Appbar.Action isLeading icon="magnify" onPress={() => {}} />
```

### Appbar.Content

New design guidelines indicate there is no <b>subtitle</b> in `Appbar.Content`, that's why there are two deprecations and the following props won't be supported anymore: `subtitle` and `subtitleStyle`.

```diff
- <Appbar.Content title="Title" subtitle="Subtitle" styles={styles.subtitle} />
+ <Appbar.Content title="Title" />
```

## Banner, Searchbar and Snackbar

According to the updates in `Surface` on the top of which `Banner`, `Searchbar` and `Snackbar` are implemented, all three component received `elevation` prop to adjust its value.

```diff
- <Snackbar style={{elevation: 1}}>Hello</Snackbar>
+ <Snackbar elevation={1}>Hello</Snackbar>
```

## BottomNavigation <i>(Navigation bar)</i>

For the sake of new animation of pill shape, indicating active destination, and assisting icon change from outlined to filled, there are three changes within `navigationState.routes` property items:

* `color` is deprecated since color is constant and the same for all routes,
* `icon` is renamed to `focusedIcon`, as the name implies, with theme version 3 it's the outline icon used as focused tab icon and with theme version 2 it's a default icon,
* `unfocusedIcon` <i>(optional)</i> is the filled icon used as the unfocused tab icon, compatible with theme version 3.

📍<i>Note: `unfocusedIcon` is optional, if you can't find outline icon equivalent, omit that prop, so `focusedIcon` will be displayed in both active and inactive state</i>

```diff
routes: [
- { key: "album", title: "Album", icon: "image-album", color: "#3F51B5" },
+ { key: "album", title: "Album", focusedIcon: "image-album" },
- { key: "library", title: "Library", icon: "inbox", color: "#009688" },
+ { key: "library", title: "Library", focusedIcon: "inbox", unfocusedIcon: "inbox-outline" },
- { key: "favorites", title: "Favorites", icon: "heart", color: "#795548" },
+ { key: "favorites", title: "Favorites", focusedIcon: "heart", unfocusedIcon: "heart-outline; },
- { key: "purchased", title: "Purchased", icon: "shopping-cart", color: "#607D8B" },
+ { key: "purchased", title: "Purchased", focusedIcon: "shopping-cart" },
]
```

The `compact` prop was also introduced, working with both themes. It indicates whether tabs should be spread across the entire width, especially in a <i>horizontal</i> mode. 

```js
<BottomNavigation compact />
```

It's worth to mention that default value of prop `shifting` depends on the theme version:
* <b>3</b> - it's `false`,
* <b>2</b> - it's `true` when there are more than 3 tabs.

Two additional props that control the scene animation were introduced that control the animation of the tabs when `sceneAnimationEnabled` is `true`:
* `sceneAnimationType: "opacity" | "shifting" | undefined` - defines the animation type for the scene. `shifting` enables a new animation where navigating to a scene will shift it horizontally into view. Both `opacity` and `undefined` have the same effect, fading the scene into view.
* `sceneAnimationEasing` allows specifying a custom easing function for the scene animation.

![shiftingAnimation](screenshots/bottom-navigation-shifting.gif)

On a final note, please be aware that `BottomNavigation` with theme version 3 doesn't have a shadow.

## Button

`Button`'s property `mode` has been expanded with two additional options:
* `elevated` - button with a background color and elevation, used when absolutely necessary e.g. button requires visual separation from a patterned background,
* `container-tonal` - button with a secondary background color, an alternative middle ground between contained and outlined buttons.

```js
<>
  <Button icon="camera" mode="elevated" onPress={onPress}>
    Elevated
  </Button>
  <Button icon="camera" mode="container-tonal" onPress={onPress}>
    Container tonal
  </Button>
</>
```

The property `color` is deprecated, but in its place two new props called `buttonColor` and `textColor` are introduced:
* `buttonColor` - custom button's background color,
* `textColor` - custom button's text color.

```diff
- <Button mode="text" color="red" onPress={onPress}>Custom text color</Button>
+ <Button mode="text" textColor="red" onPress={onPress}>Custom text color</Button>
```

```diff
- <Button mode="contained" color="red" onPress={onPress}>Custom text color</Button>
+ <Button mode="contained" buttonColor="red" onPress={onPress}>Custom background color</Button>
```

Please be aware that along with theme version 3, by default text in the `Button` component isn't uppercased and `contained` button doesn't have any shadow <i>(use then `elevated`)</i>.

## Card

The `Card` component's property `mode` has been expanded with one additional option called `contained`, which applies to the card's specified background color without any elevation and border.

```js
<Card mode="contained" />
```

## Card.Title

Since there is no one right way to make a card, there is also no one right way for specifying a title and subtitle variant. Therefore two new props come in handy:

* `titleVariant` - title text variant defines appropriate text styles for type role and its size.
* `subtitleVariant` - subtitle text variant defines appropriate text styles for type role and its size.

```js
<Card.Title
  titleVariant="headlineMedium"
  subtitleVariant="bodyLarge"
/>
```

## Checkbox.Item

`Checkbox.Item` similarly to `RadioButton.Item` has been expanded with the prop called `labelVariant`, which defines appropriate text styles for type role and its size.

```js
<Checkbox.Item 
  labelVariant="titleLarge"
>
```

## Chip

To properly compose `Chip` component and adjust into required type, there are three new props that will come in handy:

* `compact` - sets smaller horizontal paddings around the label, useful for `Chip` containing only the label,
* `elevated` - indicating whether `Chip` should be elevated,
* `showSelectedOverlay` - defining whether to display an overlay on a selected button.

```js
<>
  <Chip compact>Compact Chip</Chip>
  <Chip icon="camera" elevated>Elevated Chip</Chip>
  <Chip icon="camera" selected showSelectedOverlay>Chip with selected overlay</Chip>
</>
```

## Dialog.Icon

`Dialog.Icon` is another freshly added component presenting an icon within a `Dialog`, placed at the top of the content.

📍<i>Note: It's working only with theme version 3.</i>

```js
<Portal>
  <Dialog visible={visible} onDismiss={hideDialog}>
    <Dialog.Icon icon="alert" />
  </Dialog>
</Portal>
```
## Divider

`Divider` component received two new props:

* `bold` - divider is bolded,
* `horizontalInset` - divider has horizontal insets on both sides.

Additionally prop `inset` was renamed to `leftInset`.

```diff
- <Divider inset />
+ <Divider leftInset />
```

## Drawer.CollapsedItem <i>(Navigation rail)</i>

`Drawer.CollapsedItem` is a newly created side navigation component that can be used within `Drawer`, representing a destination in the form of an action item with an icon and optionally label.

📍<i>Note: It's working only with theme version 3.</i>

```js
<Drawer.Section>
  <Drawer.CollapsedItem
    icon="inbox"
    label="Inbox"
  />
  <Drawer.CollapsedItem
    icon="star"
    label="Starred"
  />
</Drawer.Section>
```

## Floating Action Buttons

`FAB`, `AnimatedFAB` and `FAB.Group` in the latest version can be used with four variants and two modes, thanks to two new props:

* `variant` defines color mappings variant for combinations of container and icon colors. Can be one of: <b>primary</b> <i>(default)</i>, <b>secondary</b>, <b>tertiary</b> or <b>surface</b>.

```js
<FAB variant="tertiary" />
```

* `mode` specifies whether a button should be <b>flat</b> or <b>elevated</b>:
   - `flat` - button without a shadow,
   - `elevated` - button with a shadow.

```js
<FAB mode="flat" />
```

### FAB

Additionaly `FAB` may be applied in one of three available sizes, thanks to new prop `size`: 

* `small` - FAB with small height (40),
* `medium` - Appbar with default medium height (56),
* `large` - Appbar with large height (96).

```js
<FAB size="large" />
```

However, if you would like to have your own size of `FAB`, there is a new prop called `customSize`:

```js
<FAB customSize={64}>
```

Accordingly to introducing `size="small"`, prop `small` was deprecated.

```diff
- <FAB small />
+ <FAB size="small" />
```

### FAB.Group

There is also deprecation in one of the `actions` properties, namely `small` prop is deprecated and replaced in favour of the default `size="small"`.

```diff
- <FAB.Group actions={[{ icon: "plus", small }]} />
+ <FAB.Group actions={[{ icon: "plus" }]} />
```

Additionally, the action item property previously known as `labelStyle` was renamed to `containerStyle` since it's tied mostly with the container styles. At the same time, `labelStyle` is still available with the new role related to styling item label. 

```diff
- <FAB.Group actions={[{ icon: "plus", labelStyle: styles.customStyle }]} />
+ <FAB.Group actions={[{ icon: "plus", containerStyle: styles.customStyle, labelStyle: styles.newLabelStyle }]} />
```

## IconButton

`IconButton` received two new props:

* `selected` sets alternative combination of icon and container color,

```js
<IconButton selected>
```

* `containerColor` custom background color of the icon container. 

```js
<IconButton containerColor="red">
```

At the same time, the `color` prop was renamed to `iconColor`.

```diff
- <IconButton color="red" />
+ <IconButton iconColor="red" />
```

## Menu.Item

`Menu.Item` received two new props:

* `dense` sets smaller item height for more condensed layout,
* `trailingIcon` which handles displaying an icon at the end of the item row. 

```js
<Menu.Item dense trailingIcon="chevron-up">
```

At the same time, by analogy to the second new prop, the `icon` prop was renamed to `leadingIcon`.

```diff
- <Menu.Item icon="redo" onPress={() => {}} title="Redo" />
+ <Menu.Item leadingIcon="redo" onPress={() => {}} title="Redo" />
```

## RadioButton.Item

`RadioButton.Item` has been expanded with the prop called `labelVariant`, which defines appropriate text styles for type role and its size.

```js
<RadioButton.Item 
  labelVariant="titleLarge"
>
```

## Surface

`Surface` component received one new prop:
* `elevation` - accepts values from `0` to `5` and applies background color and shadows to the `Surface` component. Supports both iOS and Android.

Previously `elevation` was passed inside the `style` prop. Since it supported not only Android, but also iOS, we decided to extract it from `style` and create a separate `elevation` prop for that.

```diff
- <Surface style={{ elevation: 1 }} />
+ <Surface elevation={1} />
```

## SegmentedButtons

`SegmentedButtons` is a completely new component introduced in the latest version. It allows people to select options, switch views, or sort elements. It supports single and multiselect select variant and provide a lot of customization options.

![segmentedButtons](screenshots/segmentedbuttons.gif)

```js
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');

  return (
      <SegmentedButtons
        value={value}
        onValueChange={setValue}
        buttons={[
          {
            value: 'walk',
            label: 'Walking',
          },
          {
            value: 'train',
            label: 'Transit',
          },
          {
            value: 'drive',
            label: 'Driving',
          },
        ]}
      />
  );
};
```

## TextInput.Icon

The property `name` was renamed to `icon`, since the scope and type of that prop is much wider than just the icon name – it accepts also the function which receives an object with color and size properties and 

```diff
- <TextInput.Icon name="magnify" />
+ <TextInput.Icon icon="magnify" />
```

## Tooltip

Component displayed upon tapping and holding a screen element or component used to present an informative text label identifying an element, such as a description of its function.

![tooltip](screenshots/tooltip.gif)


```js
<Tooltip title="Selected Camera">
  <IconButton icon="camera" selected size={24} onPress={() => {}} />
</Tooltip>
```
