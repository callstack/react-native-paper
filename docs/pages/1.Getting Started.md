Getting Started
===============

## Installation

Open a Terminal in your project's folder and run,

```sh
npm install --save react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons
```

After installation, you'll need to link [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons).


## Usage

Wrap your root component in `Provider` from `react-native-paper`. It's a good idea to wrap the component which is passed to `AppRegistry.registerComponent`.

Example:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';
import App from './src/App';

function Main() {
  return (
    <PaperProvider>
      <App />
    </PaperProvider>
  );
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent('main', () => Main);
```

The `PaperProvider` component provides the theme to all the components in the framework. It also acts as a portal to components which need to be rendered at the top level.


## Customization

You can provide a custom theme to customize the colors, fonts etc. with the `Provider` component. Check the [default theme](blob/master/src/styles/DefaultTheme.js) to see what customization options are supported.

Example:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import { DefaultTheme, Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';
import color from 'color';
import App from './src/App';

const theme = {
  ...DefaultTheme,
  colors: {
    ...DefaultTheme.colors,
    primary: 'tomato',
    primaryDark: color('tomato').darken(0.2).rgbaString(),
    accent: 'yellow',
  },
};

function Main() {
  return (
    <PaperProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </PaperProvider>
  );
}
```
