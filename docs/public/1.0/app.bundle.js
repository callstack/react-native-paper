But you will need to make sure that your `.babelrc` includes `babel-preset-expo`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"babel-preset-expo\"]\n}\n```\n\nTo get smaller bundle size by excluding modules you don't use, you can use our optional babel plugin. The plugin automatically rewrites the import statements so that only the modules you use are imported instead of the whole library. Add `react-native-paper/babel` to the `plugins` section in your `.babelrc` for production environment. It should look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"babel-preset-react-native\"],\n  \"env\": {\n    \"production\": {\n      \"plugins\": [\"react-native-paper/babel\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you created your project using CRNA or Expo, it'll look something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"babel-preset-expo\"],\n  \"env\": {\n    \"development\": {\n      \"plugins\": [\"transform-react-jsx-source\"]\n    },\n    \"production\": {\n      \"plugins\": [\"react-native-paper/babel\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** The plugin only works if you are importing the library using ES2015 import statements and not with `require`.\n\nIf you're using Flow for typechecking your code, you need to add the following under the `[options]` section in your `.flowconfig`:\n\n```ini\nmodule.file_ext=.js\nmodule.file_ext=.android.js\nmodule.file_ext=.ios.js\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nWrap your root component in `Provider` from `react-native-paper`. If you have a vanilla React Native project, it's a good idea to add it in the component which is passed to `AppRegistry.registerComponent`. This will usually be in the `index.js` file. If you have a CRNA or Expo project, you can do this inside the exported component in the `App.js` file.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';\nimport { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('main', () => Main);\n```\n\nThe `PaperProvider` component provides the theme to all the components in the framework. It also acts as a portal to components which need to be rendered at the top level.\n\nIf you have another provider (such as `Redux`), wrap it outside `PaperProvider` so that the context is available to components rendered inside a `Modal` from the library:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport { Provider as StoreProvider } from 'react-redux';\nimport App from './src/App';\nimport store from './store';\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <StoreProvider store={store}>\n      <PaperProvider>\n        <App />\n      </PaperProvider>\n    </StoreProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can provide a custom theme to customize the colors, fonts etc. with the `Provider` component. Check the [default theme](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/master/src/styles/DefaultTheme.js) to see what customization options are supported.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { DefaultTheme, Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nconst theme = {\n  ...DefaultTheme,\n  colors: {\n    ...DefaultTheme.colors,\n    primary: 'tomato',\n    accent: 'yellow',\n  },\n};\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider theme={theme}>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n",type:"markdown"},{title:"Theming",description:"",path:"theming",data:"\n## Applying a theme to the whole app\n\nTo support custom themes, paper exports a `Provider` component. You need to wrap your root component with the provider to be able to support themes.\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIf no prop is specified, this will apply the [default theme](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/blob/master/src/styles/DefaultTheme.js) to the components. You can also provide a `theme` prop with a theme object with same properties as the default theme:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { DefaultTheme, Provider as PaperProvider } from 'react-native-paper';\nimport App from './src/App';\n\nconst theme = {\n  ...DefaultTheme,\n  roundness: 2,\n  colors: {\n    ...DefaultTheme.colors,\n    primary: '#3498db',\n    accent: '#f1c40f',\n  }\n};\n\nexport default function Main() {\n  return (\n    <PaperProvider theme={theme}>\n      <App />\n    </PaperProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nYou can change the theme prop dynamically and all the components will automatically update to reflect the new theme.\n\nA theme usually contains the following properties:\n\n- `dark` (`boolean`): whether this is a dark theme or light theme.\n- `roundness` (`number`): roundness of common elements, such as buttons.\n- `colors` (`object`): various colors used throught different elements.\n  - `primary` - primary color for your app, usually your brand color.\n  - `accent` - secondary color for your app which complements the primary color.\n  - `background` - background color for pages, such as lists.\n  - `paper` - background color for elements containing content, such as cards.\n  - `text` - text color for content.\n  - `disabled` - color for disabled elements.\n  - `placeholder` - color for placeholder text, such as input placeholder.\n- `fonts` (`object`): various fonts used throught different elements.\n  - `regular`\n  - `medium`\n  - `light`\n  - `thin`\n\nWhen creating a custom theme, you will need to provide all of these properties.\n\n## Applying a theme to a paper component\n\nIf you want to change the theme for a certain component from the library, you can directly pass the `theme` prop to the component. The theme passed as the prop is merged with the theme from the `Provider`.\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Button } from 'react-native-paper';\n\nexport default function ButtonExample() {\n  return (\n    <Button raised theme={{ roundness: 3 }}>\n      Press me\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Using the theme in your own components\n\nTo access the theme in your own components, you can use the `withTheme` HOC exported from the library. If you wrap your component with the HOC, you'll receive the theme as a prop.\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { withTheme } from 'react-native-paper';\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  const { colors } = props.theme;\n  return <Text style={{ color: colors.primary }}>Yo!</Text>;\n}\n\nexport default withTheme(MyComponent);\n```\n\nComponents wrapped with `withTheme` support the theme from the `Provider` as well as from the `theme` prop.\n\n## Customizing all instances of a component\n\nSometimes you want to style a component in a different way everywhere and don't want to change the properties in the theme so that other components are not affected. For example, say you want to change the font for all your buttons, but don't want to change `theme.fonts.medium` because it affects other components.\n\nWe don't have an API to do this, because you can already do it with components:\n\n```js\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { Button } from 'react-native-paper';\n\nexport default function FancyButton(props) {\n  return <Button theme={{ fonts: { medium: 'Open Sans' } }} {...props} />;\n}\n```\n\nNow you can use your `FancyButton` component everywhere instead of using `Button` from Paper.\n\n## Gotchas\n\nThe `Provider` exposes the theme to the components via [React's context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), which means that the component must be in the same tree as the `Provider`. Some React Native components will render a different tree such as a `Modal`, in which case the components inside the `Modal` won't be able to access the theme. The work around is to get the theme using the `withTheme` HOC and pass it down to the components as props, or expose it again with the exported `ThemeProvider` component.\n\nThe `Modal` component from the library already handles this edge case, so you won't need to do anything.\n",type:"markdown"},{title:"Icons",description:"",path:"icons",data:"\n## Configuring icons\n\nMany of the components require the [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) library to render correctly. If you're using CRNA or Expo, you don't need to do anything extra, but if it's vanilla React Native project, you need link the library as described in the getting started guide.\n\nIf you opted out of vector icons support using [babel-plugin-optional-require](https://github.com/satya164/babel-plugin-optional-require), you won't be able to use icon names for the icon prop anymore. Some components may not look correct without vector icons and might need extra configuration.\n\n## Using the `icon` prop\n\nMany components such as `Button` accept an `icon` prop which is used to display an icon. The `icon` prop supports the following type of values:\n\n### 1. An icon name\n\nYou can pass the name of an icon from [`MaterialIcon`](https://material.io/icons/). This will use the [`react-native-vector-icons`](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) library to display the icon.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n<Button icon=\"add-a-photo\">\n  Press me\n</Button>\n```\n\n### 2. An image source\n\nYou can pass an image source, such as an object of shape `{ uri: 'https://path.to' }` or a local image: `require('../path/to/image.png')` to use as an icon. The image might be rendered with a different color than the one provided depending on the component. If don't want this behavior, see the next example to pass an `Image` element.\n\nRemote image:\n\n```js\n<Button icon={{ uri: 'https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/17571969?v=3&s=400' }}>\n  Press me\n</Button>\n```\n\nLocal image:\n\n```js\n<Button icon={require('../assets/chameleon.jpg')}>\n  Press me\n</Button>\n```\n\n### 3. A render function\n\nYou can pass a function which returns a react element to be used an icon. The function receives an object with `size` and `color` properties as it's argument. element is used as is without any modification. However, it might get clipped if the provided element's size are bigger than what the component renders. It's upto you to make sure that the size of the element is correct.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n<Button\n  icon={({ size, color }) => (\n    <Image\n      source={require('../assets/chameleon.jpg')}\n      style={{ width: size, height: size, tintColor: color }}\n    />\n  )}\n>\n  Press me\n</Button>\n```\n",type:"markdown"},{title:"Contributing",description:"",path:"contributing",data:"\n# Contributing to React Native Paper\n\n## [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\nWe want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other.

Fork the repo and create your branch from `master` (a guide on [how to fork a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)).\n2. Run `yarn bootstrap` to setup the developement environment.\n3. Do the changes you want and test them out in the example app before sending a pull request.\n\n### Commit message convention\n\nWe prefix our commit messages with one of the following to signify the kind of change:\n\n* `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix Button color on DarkTheme.\n* `feat`: new features, e.g. add Snackbar component.\n* `refactor`: code/structure refactor, e.g. new structure folder for components.\n* `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for Button.\n* `test`: adding or updating tests, eg unit, snapshot testing.\n* `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change circle ci config.\n* `BREAKING`: for changes that break existing usage, e.g. change API of a component.\n\nOur pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.\n\n### Linting and tests\n\nWe use `flow` for type checking, `eslint` with `prettier` for linting and formatting the code, and `jest` for testing. Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter and tests pass when commiting. You can also run the following commands manually:\n\n* `yarn flow`: run flow on all files.\n* `yarn lint`: run eslint and prettier.\n* `yarn test`: run tests.\n\n### Sending a pull request\n\nWhen you're sending a pull request:\n\n* Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.\n* Verify that `flow`, `eslint` and tests are passing.\n* Preview the documentation to make sure it looks good.\n* Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.\n\nWhen you're working on a component:\n\n* Follow the guidelines described in the [official material design docs](https://material.io/guidelines/).\n* Write a brief description of every prop when defining `type Props` to aid with documentation.\n* Provide an example usage for the component (check other components to get a idea).\n\n### Running the example\n\nThe example app uses [Expo](https://expo.io/). You will need to install the Expo app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) to start developing.\n\nAfter you're done, you can run `yarn start` in the `example/` folder and scan the QR code to launch it on your device.\n\n### Working on documentation\n\nThe documentation is automatically generated from the [flowtype](https://flowtype.org) annotations in the components. You can add comments above the type annotations to add descriptions. To preview the generated documentation, run `yarn start` in the `docs/` folder.\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nYou can report issues on our [bug tracker](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/issues).
