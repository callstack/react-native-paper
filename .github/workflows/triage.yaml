Posting a snippet of your code in the issue is useful, but it's not usually straightforward to run. A repro will help us debug the issue faster. Please try to keep the repro as small as possible. The easiest way to provide a repro is on [snack.expo.dev](https://snack.expo.dev). If it's not possible to repro it on [snack.expo.dev](https://snack.expo.dev), then you can also provide the repro in a GitHub repository."
